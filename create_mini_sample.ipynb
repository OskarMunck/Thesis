For the rest of her life. So shout out to my young queens and training program by myself. If you want to enroll your daughter, just simply send me an email to six the goddess at yahoo.com. So I want to go ahead and get right into this week. This first segment is going to be about I want to say that the entire segment. It's about toxic parenting, but we're going to talk a little bit about how our actions as parents affect our children for life or give our children things that are going to require healing. On in their life. I don't think that we are as aware as we should be that everything. We do creates our children's story. I think, you know, we kind of get caught up in our day-to-day life and forget how everything that we do will shape and mold their Tendencies their character and their ways so I'm going to play a clip here in the next segment and then we're going to jump into a discussion after this clip that is from a V103 interview with K.Michelle the center at once that what was the center like of my pain of my life. I didn't have anybody knock on wood. No one. Close to me died or anything like that everything that I've gone through has been because of lack of self-esteem and men being in the middle. What do you mean like explain that like what I don't think men are good. People wait, you think that now all men all I don't think they're good people. Why not the reason for that and I truly believe that the reason for that is like for men to do things that they consider small In the Flesh of like cheating. You know, that that's going to destroy your partner, but you do it anyway, that's not a mistake. We've watched the Story over and over again and just because I'm a woman I'm supposed to accept your betrayal right because you're taking advantage of my love for you and I'm supposed to just be the one behind you riding it out. I'm not dying with nobody. And to see girls come up to me. I'm the girl they come up to all day long crying. They tell me the most disgusting of stories that I couldn't even believe and a lot of times men the wrong man will stunt your growth as a woman women could be doctors lawyers and everything that they in the bed crying over what Amanda did to him. So how was that raising a man then because you have a son who's turning 16. I want to raise another one like like Struggling he has took off with a white girl away as looks like he's taken off with a white girl. He I get a phone call from my mama like yeah, Chase said he go on this date with some white girl. I said, okay. Okay wewe. Yeah Unity, it's all good. Right, but I didn't tell him he could go anywhere, but he ran out the house went there when I was that, you know, I'm just trying to tell him wrap it up just be like Like you you're a black person blackmail you my son, but I thought you were a black male. They don't rear that's putting it lightly. They'll kind of about you you around here with these hoodies and and these dries and stuff and you know you a straight A student. They don't know that they just see a black man hard to raise a man. Like it really is hard because I see a lot of women fail their sons because I dated them. Hmm. That was heavy. That was that was a that was a lot. Now. The reality is that she's not the only black woman that feels that way that's actually more common than I think we know. Let's just go ahead and dissect and we're dissecting that for every woman who even remotely agrees with what was just said nine times out of 10 when I observe someone who Swirls and who chooses to build with and be with someone outside their race. Nine times out of ten. I can pretty much bet on two things. I can bet that this person either had a parent of the opposite sex that was not ideal for them. That was maybe abusive or controlling or something of that nature or they grew up in one of those households were no black pride was taught where it was the focus was more so Maybe money or getting seats at the table. So they don't, you know swirling in their eyes isn't wrong because they don't have the pride of themselves and their own race because that's something that has to be taught Society definitely is not teaching children to be proud to be black and proud to be African. They're not teaching anything about Africa in school. They are not making sure these children are represented in any way all Showing these children is Martin Luther King jr. Sojourner Truth. I mean it's very limited. So if that person did not come from a household that actively taught black pride because our pride is the reason why we don't swirl we don't swirl because we understand that only a black woman can raise a black girl to be a black woman only a black man can raise a black boy to be a black man. You do your children a disservice when you procreate out. Outside of your race because you are having children with someone that your child can never fully relate to nor do they share the same privilege that that white parent has it's confusing enough being black. It's hard enough being black without now, you're not technically black but you're not technically white and you don't know where you fall. Anyone can swirl and do whatever they want. Whatever your heart desires what it comes down to is some of us have more Pride than others and that's just what it is. So when I see people that swirl, you can pretty much bet that one of those two things has occurred no black pride or an abusive parent. So now if you're abused by your parent of the opposite sex, you will subconsciously view everyone that looks like them and the same way you will look you will. Oh, look at black. You have a masculine or abrasive or black mother that beat your ass all the time. You will subconsciously when you see other black women you're running from that because you associate the black woman's face with getting your ass whooping getting screamed at getting put down. So it's like, you know going back to the interview clip. We just listened to This is a perfect example of us speaking and complaining about things without really looking at the reason behind it. Okay, so you'll sit here and say oh my son, you know ran off with a white girl. We pro-black. I just have no idea how to happen. But what you said prior to that is that you don't think men are good people. That's a very general. Strong statement to make so if you have a son that's a man. Do you do you see where I'm going with this? Do you see how even though we love our children? We can subconsciously hate and resent them because you look at your child and that child is the reminder of the black man that had a child with you and it's nowhere to be found or didn't want to be with you anymore. Even if they're in that child's life. They didn't want to have anything to do with you. So we project our subconscious hatred of men that we chose on to our children again, you cannot fool melon ated people if you have any resentment hatred or disdain for black men, your sons will feel that. Now every black woman they come in contact with they are going to assume that same feeling of hate towards them. Oh, I just don't know why our sons are going here with these white girls me while you masculine as hell bullheaded loud rude combative. He had to deal with your attitude and your mouth his whole life is some black boys that go through hell with their mamas again. I'm not saying we don't love our children black women are the most loving mothers on his Planet what I'm saying is your hate. Great for men will overpower the love for your child. You can love your child to the day is long. But if you have that subconscious hatred for men that is what they will feel first now when they grow up and it's time for them to choose a mate. They want to go for the farthest thing from you and his mind I had to spend 18 years doing with my mom's. Crap and listening to her mouth. I'll be damned if I spend a lifetime listening to that some more from another black woman and that's why I'm really like sometime when I see interracial couples. I'm working on myself. God knows I'm working on my stuff, but I can't help but to make a face when I see them like you just smelled something stank like for some reason when I see them, I just be like My face automatically assumes the position of and I'm trying to stop doing that and I'm trying to realize that for some of them trauma is pushing that them into that bologna for some of them especially the young boys. I want not now when I be seeing them with white girls, I'm like, oh baby, you told baby. You won't even have a clue. What you doing? You poor so you ain't even stand a chance because you see the mama and then you're like, oh, okay. You know what baby boy. Just go ahead with Ashley. I get it. You know, you traumatized okuu dealt with your black masculine Mama that whooped your ass for 18 years. So the first I'm talking about the first Becky that smiles at you and says, hey Tyrone you want to get ice cream. After school, he's like hell yeah. Oh, this doesn't remind me anything of the subconscious trauma I have for my mom. He want the furthest thing from it. We have to understand. Everything that you do affects your children. Everything you do will affect who they choose to be in a relationship with or even worse if they even are capable of getting and maintaining long-term healthy relationships because it's some of us that got so jacked up some people God forbid and God forgive me, but you just could tell they never they're never going to have a functional relationship. There is a such thing as someone being too. Broke it. And when someone is too broken is because you refuse to take advice you refuse to take constructive criticism you refuse to admit when you're wrong you refuse to acknowledge that you need help or need to grow people like that. They're beyond broken because you can't heal anyone that doesn't want to heal. We don't get like that by choice. You know what I'm saying? We don't choose to do that. Everything that happens in our household will shape that and our adulthood. And and this situation where K.Michelle like when I heard the clip, you know, of course, you know, people want to Dragon her and stuff like that, but this kind of X is an extension of what we were describing a few episodes ago, which is the misunderstanding of the Pussy Power. This is why I stress so much. I feel like sometimes I feel like a broken record. But let's say, you know, there was a group of you that were suffering from an illness and you found the Cure and it really worked for you. Of course, you are going to be like a static to like go back to the people and say I found the Cure you don't have to be in that pain anymore. You don't have to suffer anymore. You're going to want to share. So other people Can get better too and listen coming from someone like me for all you new listeners. It's very easy to kind of see where I am in. My life now is a as far as in my healing and romantically and my relationship with all the black men in my life not just on a romantic level, but including my father and my brothers and and stuff like that. It looks so fine and dandy and so easy now and sometimes people the sad thing is that when you do heel and you truly do love black men and appreciate them people were perceive it as you being fake or being phony and I find that to be really sad like it's sad that it has to be that way but this healing and this shift in myself truly like again, I found the antidote and I'm like coming back to my sisters because Want wait for your sisters what you want for yourself with the Cure as with anything that we're looking to manifest it comes with you truly believing what you are looking to manifest. So we don't address our trauma. We only attract bums and broken men that don't know how to be faithful that waste our time that play around we develop a subconscious. Hatred for black men we project that hatred on to our sons and then our sons grew up and don't want to have anything to do with anyone that looks like us. I was honestly the a black woman which too many of us can say this. We're almost every black man in my life wasn't shit from my baby daddy to me and my father were not speaking at the time to my brother to my uncle's I had Uncle one of my uncle's the day my mom died he called me not to console me or to send condolences but to ask me to sign off on her house he was trying to sell like I've been severely betrayed. Okay by black men in my life. It gets very easy, especially when he's black men are members of your family it I mean, we're human it's easy to to see that could push you to bitterness towards black men, but that only hurts you in a long run. Because good good black men have they value themselves to they understand that they are also a prize, you know, so it's not always that just women we have the prize a good man. It's a good price as well. Okay, good man going to protect you provide for you. That's hard to find. Okay, so the good brothers that are doing that will I you can say you don't believe this or it doesn't work. If you say it doesn't work, that means you don't really believe it. But when you have that negative energy towards them they will not come near you not all men are wired. We're just because you're beautiful or you're fine. Are you got a fat booty? They will ignore that you're toxic. There are some men who really can look at you and say oh, yeah, she cute but won't touch you with a 10-foot pole. It's a real thing. So if you're vibrating in a way that Does not allow good men to even come near you. Of course, you will think that they don't exist. Choosing bad men and creating those soul ties and thinking that it's it's fun and no big deal and just running through man after man when you're young is extremely irresponsible because then you get older you you there's no way if you screwing all through your 20s, okay, the tent chances of you bringing a child into the world are high. Okay, so we play around we don't really think long-term. We don't heal. We're in denial that we even need to heal. I think by now all black people and I can say this confidently all black people have something they need to heal from okay, we are and living in a world and a system that wants us dead and actively tries every single day to break us and break us apart and has been doing so for hundreds of years and words of generations before us generational trauma is a real thing generational insecurities generational curses are real things. Every black person needs to be honest with themselves and say I'm going to need some serious healing and some kind of way. Okay that needs to be something that we can really get on the fur on one page with you have an entire system engineer toward making you hate each other making you fail and try You kill you I would say that's definitely traumatizing and everything that we do is different for us than is for anyone else. Things don't work for black people like they do for everyone else in this world. It's a completely different ballgame when you go to talking about us. So we ignore we know we're so busy in this social media world where we want to make everything seem like it's all right, we get very consumed and things looking good and looking like that. We truly forget to make sure that we good in real life. Okay, so We as a parent. Sometimes it's going to require. I know this is going to sound crazy guys, but it does require putting your children before yourself sometimes. Oh my God. Nobody had no idea. So by ignoring our traumas we are it's actually a form of abuse and bad parenting because now you're putting issues on your children at they had nothing to do with and didn't ask for your Healing you're learning how to cohabitate coexist how to build with the opposite sex of your race is a duty to your children if you have them. Now if you don't have children, you know, what you do is pretty much only affecting you and that's your business, you know, but if once you have children, you're obligated you are obligated. Nobody cares what you think or how you feel or what you want. We don't care that you don't want to heal your traumas. You have to if you don't they will pass on to your children. If you don't your children will grow up and want to get with someone who Earns them absolutely nothing of you. Your children will grow up and struggle like so many of us to keep and maintain healthy relationships. Sisters Let It Go I want you to say this out loud Let It Go, raise your vibration raise your standards stand firm in those standards. We cannot continue to berate and belittle our sons, then when they grow up and want to get with white women, we cannot condemn them with this same man. Of that we fuss at them with for 18 years. We cannot keep throwing our children under the bus for the decisions that we make without taking into account ability to part that we play we all grew up with that generation apparent where we couldn't say anything to them. We all see what that resulted in. Okay, we all see that didn't work out too. Well, okay my generation the generation Duration of children should be seen not heard sit down. Shut up. Don't say anything. Um, that did not work out. Look at our low marriage rates High divorce rates. STD rates unwed pregnancy rates infant mortality rates. It did it did not work out. It didn't work out. So it's are you know, we're in the age of communication you can communicate with anyone. On this planet pretty much at the blink of an eye. There's no excuse for not being able to communicate ideas with each other. So it's kind of like we're at this town hall meeting like all right. Listen guys. We're definitely going to have to construct a different system of parenting because the old school system didn't work out so well and from what I see the new generation is not going in a good direction the way I see the Next Generation going. I'm actually terrified. I'm terrified to get old and know that this next generation is going to be like running shit. Like I don't I don't feel confident in it. It doesn't I don't like it. I don't like it. So we have to take that responsibility. I feel like there's definitely a different sense of responsibility when you are the parent who is the opposite sex of the child because again, the opposite sex is who They're going to grow up and you know want to pursue and that's what they're going to be with so your actions towards them are it's under a different kind of microscope as a black man. What you do will definitely affect your daughters as they as they grow up and you know, I know some people that grew up with a mother and father. Other and still kind of struggle. I noticed different struggles with them either. It's kind of a blessing and a curse when you have like a good black mom and dad who had a great relationship because now you have such a healthy view of what a relationship is supposed to be in a generation that is relationship retarded. So I think it can be hard for someone who came from a healthy environment. Like that to kind of get what someone who's on like the same Pages them because most of us didn't have that most of us pretty screwed up. So I noticed that their struggle can be finding someone who you know is on the same Pages than because then relationships hit a little bit different when you witnessed your mom and dad and a healthy one. I think it gives them a super high standard and expectation that Sometimes they have issues finding in this effed-up Society or I've seen some girls that had their dad had their mom, but their mom was like a pushover and let their father get away with too much. So they're in their mind it can kind of mess them up the opposite way because if you have both of your parents, but their relationship was unhealthy it can then make your mind say oh Relationship period whether they're black white or purple is going to cause you stress or they watch their mama crying every night and that's what they associate a relationship with being. That's why you know, it's important to understand if you're in a relationship. That's unhealthy. It is so much better to leave than to stay in it because even though we push for black marriage and black relationships if it's not a healthy one, it's not helping. And it's not helping the kids when you have children or what someone you definitely want to make sure that you know, that's the person you want to be with long-term. Make sure that you take the time to really get to know each other and be on the same page but in the same breath just because you have children with someone does not mean you should stay with them if the situation is unhealthy because like I said that also is still a negative thing because now that child will grow up and not want to have anything to do with In relationships if they saw a negative one their whole life. Okay. I just wanted to have this discussion because it just seems so common now that we're speaking on the children and what they do and we're like not really being realistic to the impact that everything we do they see. And that is going to affect them and we cannot keep playing the game of like pretending that everything's okay because it's just making things worse. Y'all take a look at these kids nowadays is just like I feel so old saying this but it's just like no morals. No pride. No kind of dignity. It's extremely money-hungry, you know when we have so many children born into broken situations. It's just making them one of the fuel and kind of Channel all of their energy into like material things like in their mind our relationship. They don't even see the point in it because most of them weren't even born into relationships. They weren't even born with a purpose. They weren't born on purpose. So be careful. I said all that to say be careful. Our children are watching us everyone in some way shape or form becomes a product of their environment. And most importantly if you do have your children who are swirling, I think you need to seriously talk to them. Ask them. You know, what made you choose that person What attracted you to that person because you may discover other types of trauma that maybe you were not aware of before so don't be afraid to have those discussions with your kids. If that does happen because it can be a chance for you to kind of reflect on your own actions as a parent so that we can be aware of certain things so that we are not kind of transferring that any further. We really I feel like we are truly the generation of breaking Cycles. I feel like we are truly the generation to kind of transcend. So I think you know, you know you guys have been a while since I've given homework. Well this week my homework is going to be a time of self-reflection to have a conversation with your children. It's okay to talk to your children and ask them. How am I doing as a parent? How are you feeling so that we're not waiting until our children are grown and going off the deep end before we realize there's a problem. So where we can Kind of monitor things as they go so everybody sit down have that realistic conversation with yourself have that realistic conversation with your kids so that we can avoid this type of stuff. Come on, you find young Brothers you need to be, you know looking for women that you want you want to to seek a woman that's like your mother not wanting to find someone who's a total opposite we got to do. better Ladies and gentlemen, what you have just heard is a bitch ass nigga. in his native environment who you just heard was the brother of Botham Gene fathom. Jean was the black man that was murdered in his apartment by a white police officer named Amber Geiger. We're going to just break this down because There's so much in this there's so much in this that I think a lot of people are not even aware of. I first want to point out the power of white woman tears. If you notice Amber was a brunette when the crime was committed. She actually died her hair blond for the trial. I'll because the wider that she looked the more blonder and blue eyes wider and wider that she looked in this trial. She knew the better of the chance she has for sympathy and understanding now the first thing that I'm going to say about this is that Negroes like him are the same Negroes that will sit in this courtroom and hug the bitch that killed your blood. Those same niggas are the ones where when it comes to their own people. They'll say we deserve everything that happens to us because we kill each other. These are the same type of negroes. That will say, I'm not black. I'm human. Okay. These are the same niggas these these are the same Negroes that pull the human car whenever they're dealing with who they love. Of Masa the crackers when it comes to the crackers, they have all the understanding forgiveness and unity and love in the world when it comes to their own people. Those are niggas that be like well black lives don't matter because we look at when we do to each other. Those are the Negroes that will say shit. Like, whoa, I can't really get mad that we kill each other that that white people kill us. We kill each other after all. Okay. These are the Negroes that Harriet would have shot. Okay. Oh sweet mother Harriet. I know you would have shot this nigga. I know it. I just know you would. God bless the day Queen Mother Harriet. So this is why it's so dangerous when black people say, I'm the black words on the human race. I don't see color baby boy. You ain't got to see color, but they do and then they use Negroes like you unaware of the color Negroes like you that tried to erase color as taut as tools and Pawns in white and racism and white supremacy. I'm just going to go ahead and say this I don't have a nice way of saying this I'm just going to go ahead and say it at this point. in this age of information and this age of communication I can definitely say from the bottom of my heart that I truly feel like Christianity is officially a form of mental delusion. and illness period I said it. Yeah. I said it it's mental illness at this point. Our great-great grandmother's died waiting for Jesus. Our great-grandmother's died waiting for Jesus. Our grandmother's die Waiting on Jesus. And here we are still waiting on Jesus here. We are. The only ones that are truly applying what your Bible teaches you which is to be obedient to your master. And your master is the crackers. Panting crackers tell you hey. Hey. Hey, we don't do that Pro black stuff. That's hateful. Okay, we don't see color. Remember repeat after me. We don't see color repeat after me. Not all white. People are bad. All right. Y'all are y'all are hold on. I don't know. What you doing with all this looking out for your own race and you know not swirling with us anymore and not forgiving us when we kill you, but stick to the code here repeat. After me, you're not black. You're human. I don't know why you Negroes are are acting all uppity here, but we have a system here and we need you all to stay with it. Okay caring for your own people. That's that's not christ-like. Remember, you should love us all you should you should take care of us. All you should help us all okay, and any black person that steps outside the code is labeled as agent hateful races. I can't tell y'all some of the things they call me. I'm the villain, you know people my people that are like me where the villains okay racism and white supremacy is not the reason behind anything. The real problem is you Negroes that speak up about it. Okay, don't the racism is not the problem the loving of crackers more than you love yourself is not the problem. The mental illness is not the problem. The problem is when you talk about The problem is when you hold us accountable for our parts in it. We don't talk about that. Let's just say not all white. People are bad Love Is Love we don't see color and keep it moving. Okay, we don't need y'all trying to deconstruct our system that keeps us alive. Our grandparents their grandparents. They do not have the technology that we have. They did not have the means that we have. Okay, their Bible and Christianity was pretty much all they had like, you know, everybody got to have something that they have Hope and Faith in for me. It's my ancestors and it's myself and it's the universe. That's what I believe in. That's what is consistent. That is what is true. And that's what's real. I understand that everything that happens in my life. I'm in control of I understand that if something is going wrong in my life. It is up to me to get myself out of it is up to me to protect myself. It is up to me to demand respect for myself. No one is going to do these things for you. So that is what I'm rocking with me. I bet on me I put all My money on me. Okay. Now you have some Negroes that decide to put everything into someone or something that they never met into a book that was translated by someone. They don't know they don't know that person's intentions. You're you you're giving a book and on the cover. It says translation and you still swear by that that is mental illness. You don't need that book to tell you right from wrong. Everyone knows right from wrong. Some may exercise it and some may not but everyone knows. Okay, you've watched all your Generations died and Jesus never came. So now we're fast forwarding a 2019 and you're still. You're still like on board. Are you crazy? My answer is yes, you crazy at this point. You just crazy. I mean, I don't know how else to say it like, it's not even that serious. It's just a book. It's just a man-made religion and you're basing your whole lives on this. You don't know them people. You don't know them people that made this created this wrote this you don't know that you don't know their credentials. You don't know their intentions. You don't know their morals. You have no idea and yes what you're basing your whole life off of Gary here. You crazy. You have no confidence in yourself. You need to believe in someone else because you don't have the will power and the strength to handle yourself. You don't want it. That's that's a heavy weight on your shoulders when you realize no one's coming to save you. No one is showing you favored over someone else we all out here. You're on your own figure it out. That's a lot for a lot of people to to accept. I think most people are not built to accept that they need to feel like someone is eventually coming to save them. They need to feel like okay if I just follow this book and follow this church. I'm going to make it to Heaven. They need to believe that they don't want the responsibility of having to create their own Heaven having to save themselves. That's that's a that's a big weight on your shoulder. So I understand not everyone is that strong? Okay, I want to just say this if I ever skill and anyone he I swear to I'm curling my lip up right now. Like when your mama is basically telling you when you're in the store that she finna whoop your ass and she's trying to give you the look of so, you know the chill I'm curling my lip up like that if I'll get killed and one of y'all hug mom murderer, I'm gone. I'm going to come back to life on your ass. Okay, I'm going to pop up out the ground swear to God. I wish a nigga would hug a cracker that killed me. Are you crazy? And how come we don't forgive our own people like that? See I forget my own people like that before I forgive a cracker. Yeah, right. Because when my own people kill each other, I know you don't really want to do that. You've been brainwashed to do that. We're the most kindest most loving and forgiving people in this planet. You killed your brother that's a sign of self-hatred and that's a sign of brain washing. You don't even know what you do forgive my brother because he don't know what he does. That's my attitude towards my I will have that attitude towards my own people before I ever in my life had that attitude towards a cracker. Especially a female cracker. Yeah, right. They're the devil's keyholders. They birthed the devil's. Yeah, right, and I'm dead and Cold Blood and have my life taken away. And and you going to hug this bitch this bitch this whole so now let's go and let's go into some more facts about this case that were quickly silenced when it first came out. Some people may not know this because like I said, they took Dave drug this Shin off of the air real quick. Okay. Did y'all know that Amber Geiger and Jean bothame had a relationship of sorts of some sort. This was not just the way she's telling it like. Oh, I just happened to walk into the wrong apartment. And I thought someone was in my house and I shot them know they knew each other. They knew each other. They had a relationship of some sort with each other. This is why I had spoke about this before but this is why I like when I hear about a black person getting killed by somebody white. I my first reaction is not to like jump up and be like, I'm outraged. How could this happen this poor man? I gotta I'm sorry, but I got before I spend my energy or my time. I gotta just check on a few things first. Okay, I got it I got Check out something. I need to know who is this next period because if you own that BS, I'm sorry, but there's too many of us that do get it and there's too many of us that understand what's really going on here for me to waste my time or my tears or my emotions on anyone who just wants to want to not understand to anyone who is committed to misunderstanding. So I heard about it and I said, okay, let me let me let me let me see what's going on with this, dude. Child, this dude is the Christian of Christians. He definitely is the we're not black where human type guy and what y'all are not realizing is if you as a black man. Fuck with a white woman and something happens to you. I'm legally blind and it's above me now. Okay. Peopie, hold it down Mama. I love you. Okay. I have no words for you. I don't know what to tell you baby. Boy. This ain't rocket science has it's just it's not Chinese arithmetic. I mean, this is really not that hard. I mean we've seen this for centuries of black man dying at the hands of white vagina. Okay. So if you don't watch all your forefathers died at the hands of this white vagina and you go into that sunken, I just don't know what to tell you. I mean sometimes self-hatred is so real that people subconsciously want to commit suicide some of them. They subconsciously want to die. Okay good the soon as he put his seat in that white soil. I mean, you just killed your genetics. Anyway, they don't want themselves to carry on that self-hatred is a real thing and it's one of the realest things that we face and it's also one of the top things were unaware of exactly what it is why it started and how it works so many people that hate themselves. Don't even know it that's crazy. And that's why it's not getting better because people are not even aware of it you deal with white girls because you want to kill yourself you want to die because you are not really carrying on when you plant your seeds in a white woman. That's not a black child. Okay that you diluted your genetics. You've created a biracial child a mulatto child. You didn't want your child to look like you you didn't want to create your twin. You want it to have a child. It's so many black men. I see what he's mixed babes. I see the babe. I know that baby. Don't look nothing like you you actually look ridiculous. That baby. Don't look shit like your ass. Why would you not want your children to look like you? Carry around these and I swear. I don't know it's because there's been so much swirling going on but it's like the mix kids have been looking less and less black like it's kids that are mixed and they just look completely white. Now, they don't or they look like white Hispanics, but they don't even be looking black at all and and man see that and that's what they go for self-hatred. Somebody want to kill themselves. I mean, there's nothing you could do about it. Today is suicide. It is a form of suicide. So you do know what a white woman, so I'm happy to you baby. I mean What are we supposed to do? We seen how this happened? It don't matter how much she likes your black penis and how much you like her white vagina. Guess what? There is still privilege there is still a privilege that she has over you no matter what Okay, women in general have somewhat of a privilege over men where it's most likely where you know, if a woman says a man hit her that the system will believe the woman. So that's already a thing where women of any race really can pull that card. It's less likely that when black women pull the card it'll actually work because a lot of times when black women pull that card baby girl you end up going to jail to he take they take both of you out of jail all y'all going to jail. All you are going to jail. Okay, but I mean, like I said in some cases in general, you know, a woman can say oh a man hit me and more than likely they'll believe her over him. So that's already a thing now add in that she's white and you're black you trust these crackers that much that you're willing to give a white woman that much power. She had the power to really ruin you. I mean she got the power we're at the snap of her fingers. She can take you down and they're and they're going to protect and believe her way before they'll ever protected believe your black ass majority of the time. Not me personally. I am putting that much trust in nobody. I'd rather be with a sister where baby girl you want us to go down baby. We going down together. You know what I'm saying? You caught up all these baby girl. I probably take you to jail too. So, you know, I can't have it be worth a minute. Somebody cry a tear. Like they automatically like that's it. It's the end of the road. This is what it is. Once them white woman tears come that's it for your black ass. So now let's review this man's mental illness a step further. Now it's a white woman. That's a police. Oh, sweetie. I'm not grabbing you jumping over that cliff and risking going down with you on your own baby. I don't know what to tell you. White women have notoriously acted out whenever they are denied black dick or rejected by black dick. They've been getting niggas killed for that shit for centuries. Okay, we talk about this all the time that when physical slavery was going on the white women see some black dick. She want it. He had to get with her and don't tell my husband and you better not Tell nobody that we did this or else I'm going to say you raped me. So, you know that is rape that you think men can be raped men could be right because basically blackmailing a man into giving you his penis is great. Okay, so they've been notorious for showing their lack of natural ass whenever black man have taken away the D. So, although do we know bothame personally do we know Amber personally know? No, but what I do know is that woman did not walk in there and kill that man for no reason nor did this bitch think this was her apartment. Now, she had been at apartment before for show. Oh, yeah. She had been in that apartment. Yeah with him dirty feet in the air with a little pink feet in the air. Yeah little pink booty was in the air and that apartment. Yeah, that's why she, you know, she's so comfortable to walk up in there that I want her first time in there. All right. Yeah, she went in To give up that little salami. Oh, yeah, okay brothers and sisters. We have to learn that everybody is responsible for themselves and their own actions. We cannot save everybody and everybody is not our responsibility. Okay, anybody that want to get it is going to get it and he won that doesn't they're not we cannot waste our time and energy are energy as black people as powerful. We're melon ated beings what we put energy in produces a result of some sort. So when we all cried over a negro that committed suicide in my eyes I mean what you know this real life. I mean, it sucks but life got to go on we can't waste our time. Okay, how dare that brother hug? This whole that killed. This woman is a murderer. That is the that is the real power of white supremacy. This is a perfect example on himself six of God is not all white people are bad baby all white people get privilege over you. I don't care if they're good or bad that has nothing to do with anything what has to do is a privilege that exists whether they're nice to you or mean to you that privilege still exist period Okay, the reason why it's dangerous to quote unquote forgive your murderers forgive your attackers is because there's a certain way that human nature Works humans have to have Law and Order humans have to have consequences behind what they do okay if they don't human nature will naturally go as far as you let it there re cut some people say well if he forgave her that's his business he wanted to have Is no no no no. No. That's not what this is about. The reason why the forgiveness and hugging and all that is so dangerous. It's because it's the power of visualization. The power of visual visualization once a human sees an image it affects the way they think they view they feel it affects you it affects your subconscious. And again, your subconscious is more powerful than your conscious mind because it operates on its own. It's not something you can control. That's why you have to be careful and what you feed the subconscious. So when you was a black person get on national television and hug a white woman that killed your black brother the message you are sending is it's okay to kill black people. Oh my God, they're not going to think. It's okay to kill like it because want no no no. Yes, they will. Yes. They will it can take just one. It can take just one to influence people's minds that way. Okay, when the hell have you ever seen a judge get down off of the stand and hug a murderer? When have you ever seen that? The second place is a real thing. The judge in this case is a black woman the ones who birth black men and she got her ass off the stands crying with a tissue and off to hug this cracker. Do you see how white supremacy uses our people to further put us in the ground? I wonder how much they got paid. I wonder how much do you have to get paid to shit on your brother's Soul. How much was it? You don't hug this cracker time? I know you want to find peace. Let me tell you the hell did you were going to end or when you join the ancestors one day and they looking at you like you're going to really know what it is to be tormented. It really know. What hell is when you have to face your ancestors. Okay, that's what people don't understand. They just they get so caught up in this lifetime and then you know, you're not even thinking about this is short. Okay, you have a you have a bigger, you know a bigger Journey going on here pal. You just dropped the ball use fumble flag on the play. Again, the reason why they had the judge crying the reason why they had the officer fixing Amber's hair is because of the power and visuals that you're all in denial about. Okay, everyone's in denial about visualization and visuals and how powerful they are. Everyone swears. They're less powerful than what they really are. And it clearly is that's why you know, they have all the black people tending to her to show look look see I'm not racist. See, I'm going to get 10 years eligible for parole after five. I'll be out in four. Okay, they're going to bring me gourmet food and that bitch I'm getting constant protection. I don't have to worry about anything and the only reason why she went to jail is because this was the white man sending a message as well to white women of see what happens when you fuck with these niggers. Okay, if that was a white man that did that to a black woman. He would have got probation. Wouldn't go to jail, but see again white men notoriously treat their women like shit as well. So they let her go to jail because it's like that's because she was fucking with a black man and we all know how white men feel about black penises that that's their number one threat always has been and that's why they always have killed black man for touching their women because they know what that black D do. Okay, so that's why they even let her go to jail at all but they they're like well, he's give her an not enough to ruin her life, but just enough to show her. This is what you get because you've messed with a black guy Amber. This whole thing go deep at the can it go way deeper than we're giving it credit this this whole thing was just such an example of where we really are as a people and how much work we really have to do. It is such an example of why not all black people can go of why I say don't get it twisted. You see me very Pro black but it does not mean I have the desire to unite with all of my people because niggas like that got to stay the fuck out my face we Nothing to talk about and we have nothing in common and you're dangerous. You was a black man hugging a white woman for killing your black brother. Maybe I have a black son. And I know how dangerous what you did is and I know how it devalues your life and the life of your other of your brothers. There's no other race that is having you murdered their blood and they're going to get on TV and hug you the reason why black people don't kill white people and majority. It's because they know there's going to be a consequence to it you Don't see black man out here killing white women because they know I killed this white woman. Someone's coming after me. That's how you keep yourself protected. That is how human minds work to know. If I mess with this person there is a consequence there something that will hurt me humans don't care about hurting other people. They care about themselves humans are naturally selfish and greedy. So when you show them that there is no consequence for harm. You this is why it's open season on us now. And this is why it's dangerous and this is why it's our business. Congratulations, they played themselves brothers and sisters kings and queens. We are out of time for this week. I will see you all next week. And as always peace love and black power.

Welcome to psychic Evolution and now Jamie Clark and Maggie Norton and welcome back to season two of psychic Evolution. I am your host Jimmy Clark and I'm your co-host Maggie nor in what we're going to talk about today. Is bringing in the new energy and learning to let go and learn from the old energy creating a whole new Dynamic of life experience. Not only that the natural cycles and rhythms of life and first finding them within yourself and then within the natural world of experience, we're going to get into some of what I call Soul Cycles from the macrocosm to the microcosm and a reflection from above so below and vice versa. It's all energy. And numbers and aspect of what are the natural laws of the universe one plus one equals two as we bring in a whole new season. We're bringing in a whole new energy with it. Jimmy and I were talking about how every cycle has its own flavor each and every one of us has a rhythm and has a cycle that we tune ourselves to we are all a tuning ourselves to the Natural rhythm in the natural world that we live in. Which does involve seasons and nature and numbers and influences that create energetic structures that influence a global Consciousness. So the first thing we really want to address during this podcast is what are your natural cycles? How do you discover them? And why are they so important to your psychic Evolution the three natural cycles of life our birth life and death and each one of these Cycles. Really help us to tune into our natural state of being now understanding that when you're in a birth cycle, you're going to be starting new things. You'll have the energy to initiate to catalyze to get things moving. Maybe you're going to be brainstorming or daydreaming about what you want to build or what you want to accomplish or what you want to create in your life. But and those birth Cycles everything just kind of starts building. Okay, there's a sense of Building in those birth cycles and it's a it's a momentum that you feel before. It's actually in our outward manifestation. And then in the life cycle when you're in that life cycle, you're on top of the world. You're moving towards those dreams. You've already done the initiation and now you're on autopilot here, you're riding the wave of life and it's such a beautiful time in that cycle where you get to just kind of keep creating keep building keep changing and shifting and growing. But all through something that you've birthed inside of yourself, maybe it's an energy. Maybe it's a whole new you this could be a career could be a job. It could be a relationship. It could be anything. It could be something as simple as implementing a new way of being or a new lifestyle like walking every day. So these can be any aspect of life from very big events to very very small events. Now the third cycle is the death cycle. The death cycle is about letting go and it takes as much if not more energy to let go as it does to birth something both of those Cycles take a ton of energy. So during the cycles of birth life and death when you're letting go at death and all those Cycles. We feel differently in life. When you are truly ready to let go of something you feel much different than when your birthing something and much different than when you're on. On autopilot. So it's a really important thing to get in tune with who you are in your natural cycle because what it can do for you is allow you to understand how your natural cycle can be worked with a lot of times. We feel overwhelmed. Sometimes we feel numb. Sometimes we feel apathetic or held back or ready to burst. Sometimes we're very comfortable and so we can understand our own. Troll cycles and learn what we're feeling and then we can transmute that and translate that into how it can help us grow psychically as well and being able to learn from those experiences to build on that solid X of Life Experiences huge in that Rhythm of Life as mag was saying find that wave that conscious wave and find your own unique Rhythm as you dance to the Rhythm of Life your own beat. That Cadence is how you're going to stand out the uniqueness of who you are. That's what people Vibe with you find that passion in life. Whatever it is. That's what speaks to people as well as it speaks to you. It becomes that reflection that connection and that integration of those rhythms of the flow. And as we do that and become a little bit more clear on accepting a reality before it's even there. I've learned more effectively to allow. Circumstances and experiences to happen as it comes to me. It does not mean I sit on the couch and do nothing. But those who know me and you know, I always talk about creating future memories. I've done this enough and consistently to get a similar result a lot of the times now I started with the littlest things first, keep it simple and keep it easy build upon those basics for myself. It's been a life of building on step at a time. I found that if I tried to jump my I Consciousness to a major level as I saw it. I was like, yes, it's amazing. But am I missing something because I got a big void that I just kind of went beyond being able to find that each experience each lifetime learning to know what it is, which is that life experience. Can we gain the knowledge can we learn to live with that experience whatever it is good bad happy sad as the experience of what it is gaming that knowledge of my soul adduct of information to be able to create a better. Now a better future as we perceive it because for me I keep creating future memories and they keep happening more. So and as I've learned to clear it up and become the microcosm and the macrocosm because it's a reflection I've learned that what I think about does tend to become reflected in my life experience. And you see that those who talk about lat limit those talk about abundance are living it and you don't see successful people going to are saying their failure learning those rhythms are huge and will allow me to go with the flow much more trustingly and effectively and easily because I've realized that life is not happening to me. It's happening because of me those rhythms are so interesting because it's all about balance in the end. You know, we want to balance our mental or physical or spiritual and emotional parts of ourselves. And in those rhythms just as Jimmy said you're taking all the wisdom of this experience to your soul. Essence to your over soul. And if you can understand the birth cycle the life cycle and the death cycle of each and every experience. You're taking more wisdom home with you more wisdom to really just be full and Rich and it's through the understanding of cycles that helps us to not repeat cycles that we don't wish to repeat and I don't know how many times you know, people will come to Me or I and you know, they're going through the same thing over and over again and they say why does this keep happening to me? And if you understand your Cycles you can understand which area of those Cycles needs to be worked with or needs to be healed. And as we work with those Cycles we can learn that we don't need to repeat them. So when that death cycle does come up in those experiences. We have more of an understanding through all the times. We went through that experience as Where we can support that death cycle and again remember it takes so much energy just to let go in that dying process and most of us we think of letting go is such a passive thing and it really is it's a surrendering but how much energy do we need to surrender? How much energy do we need to fully let go of a pattern? It's not easy to yeah learn to live out the life experience because those who know me know what I agree. I grew up with in some ways at least a little bit of that and I had to learn to live with that because it could have eaten me up in a very very strong way and it could have been a completely different person had I not chosen to find another Rhythm another direction for myself and my soul being able to learn the best that we can to live with that because I had such an emotional connection and intensity to a lot of those experiences it can sometimes Stop you in your tracks of life experience as you're moving now and will tend to come from more of the past and a lot of times more of what we don't want rather than what we do want and even though we have the right intent. We keep vibing with the negative as we perceive it. So we'll keep getting more of that in readings and I am so honored and thankful that doing this my whole life and for the past 20 years professionally I have healed myself. Self so much and in so many ways by helping others. It's a win-win I have gone back when I'm assisting others in readings to a lot of my own life experience when I'm shown that and in doing that I have gone back to so many of those experiences consistently that I've lost a lot of the emotional intensity. Hey, and I now see that experience for what it is is the life experience. Can I learn from that? Can I gain the knowledge of that and can I gain the wisdom to be able to use that knowledge effectively first being able to help myself? Otherwise, how am I going to help others, but as I do help myself the best that I can and if I'm doing what I'm saying, I'm doing you know, just maybe maybe the something to what I'm saying. I want to empower you to empower yourself. I don't do that competition if I did and you know you do you'll always be upset and frustrated because there's always somebody better somebody worse and if you keep doing that That you'll live in the void you live in everyone else's energy and not your own stand out. I do what you find your own Rhythm your life dance the dance of life in your Rhythm the uniqueness of your soul print of Consciousness. However, you're able to if you can those kinds of tools and techniques going back in assisting others. I'm assisting myself, but if you're able to go back and in a way Vibe with what was some of the knowledge uh, what was some of the learning experience that you gained from that particular aspect keep it real easy and light in the very very beginning trying to go for the soul saturation because I can become very overwhelming finding my soul and the Soul cycles of what I experienced that's huge and each experience empowers me to find more knowledge and awareness of other things that are connected of the interactions with other people and realizing that my past can be what it is the past experience of learning I do not have to keep repeating the pattern because I've learned to live with it with less distraction and more focus of what I accept now as the interaction co-creating with others and for psychic Evolution, we think about the cycles that we go through as we're building our intuition as we're gaining insight and awareness and having these beautiful experiences that we really can be And with and for psychic Evolution, there may be times where you're feeling like an activation times and expansion times. That's like a birth phase that's opening things up. It's like a new level of Consciousness a new expansion and new awareness. Now the life cycle is what are you going to do with that expansion? What are you going to do with the activations that happen within you? So when we receive psychic information the life cycle asks us will how are you going to play this? Us out now you're in this lifetime you have these gifts your you have this perception you are who you are right here right now. So what are you going to do right now with those activations and expansions and then the death cycle is maybe those times where we aren't hearing is clearly maybe those times where there's a softening or we're not getting as many messages because it's not a time of activation is not a time of figuring things out. It's a time of integrating. And death is a time of integration because we're integrating frequencies so that we can get ready to be birthed a new the death phase is right before we start the birth phase. Right? So before that there is a quiet and there is a Stillness that can happen and at those times in our psychic Evolution, we sometimes have to look and be like, oh, why is it so quiet? I'm not getting any messages or my guides aren't as clear as they normally are and when you You understand your Cycles, you understand your psychic Evolution Cycles because you're going to be working with the physical and the spiritual Cycles which are going to be mirror images of each other. So you can look at your everyday life. What's happening in your physical body or mental your body your emotional body and then you can understand that's also a part of your spiritual body. So when we're looking at our intuition and the Consciousness that we're developing in life. Understanding your Cycles on either end of that Spectrum helps you become more integrated and you can be patient with yourself as you're developing through this during these Cycles. You may feel overwhelmed or numb apathetic constrained ready to burst or hopefully a little bit more comfortable knowing what you feel and allowing yourself to feel will help you identify more knowledge and information about that. Perience doesn't make it okay, but finding your own Rhythm your own steps your own Cycles to help teach and heal and Empower yourself. And the more that you're able to do that in identify kind of where your energy seems to be placed in creating those Cycles. You'll begin to get into more of a balance of the mental the physical the spiritual and emotional that all come together in a way to play with each other in every part of the cycle because it's all in Connected as you work with one you began to nourish and harmonize the other and then they work together with the power in numbers now as were connecting more with those Cycles. We're going to get into Seoul Cycles when we get back. Hey there, I'm Jamie Clark and I'm Maggie Norton host of psychic Evolution. We are here to share some great news with you. I participated in scientific studies as an evidential psychic medium this scientific research at the University of Arizona recently demonstrated that life continues after bodily death to learn more about this amazing technology, visit sulfone dot-org and in 2020. You can attend public demonstrations of this technology at seed events to learn more visit Seoul found dot-org forward slash. Greater reality living groups are now forming. So people can learn the evidence that death is not the end of life and also to meet open-minded people in a safe and inclusive setting to share your personal spiritually transformative experiences and hear those of others. Also consider how you can best serve yourself others in our world to learn more about these groups visit greater reality living.com. You can become a member and assist this project for as little as $5 per month to learn how visit Seoul phone dot-org forward slash get involved As the sun as the Cycles planners that spin around and evolve and revolve like we have our day-to-day life experience on this planet and the cycles of what we experience. We have the sole cycles of our eternal life experience in each of those Soul Cycles you and to find patterns waves of Consciousness and connection and what I mean by that is soul cycle is what we choose as an eternal being on the cycle age as I call it of coming back to this planet and what experiences can we learn from this for our own soul growth the ability to cycle through these events these experiences and connections with other people in our All groups that there is a lot of comfort that we're set up for in seeing the cycles that ability to know, you know what this amount of time this amount of recycling. Wait a minute. There's something we do on this planet that's very very important to us exactly recycling on so many levels. Will it be reflected in our day-to-day living in our own life experience being able to see those rhythms can also help you to become more proactive? Ben life that if you get that, okay, we have this one number two three, and you know what every time I hit number four tends to kind of make a big adjustment. So what I'm going to be doing is on that third adjustment, I'm going to be amping it up so that the fourth adjustment has more power and energy exactly. You'll be able to find that Rhythm. You'll create your own Rhythm and your own waves and you going to make it a little bit more fun to ride the wave or is it going to get a little Freaky Deaky to slamdance you because a lot of us tend to fear. That and understandable. But again, if you focus on what you fear, it's going to cycle through and give you more of what you fear. We're not ignorant. Here's my solution and I found that the flow my focus my ability to redirect as well as recycle that energy vibration of success and notice the importance of what we do on this planet is to not waste things like not wasting our time are the wasting the experience of being here the To recycle that to create a new reality or a new dynamic or vehicle. And in this case for the human consciousness and ability to interact with others in our life experience and to realize that not only in a rhythm of recycling but also the physical body basically every seven years is recycled with about 50 trillion new cells each time that is physical. Those kinds of interactions will also get you sold a realize well in a minute every seven years my energy is Shifting so I can create a new mental thought pattern and as I'm attaining those new cells and their recycling. I'm going to amp it up even more I'm going to be able to have that intent that a vibration of acceptance that I can hold more knowledge higher frequencies and integrate it and cycling through my beingness through this physical body. And be able to experience live love and learn with and from life. Not only that my own soul experience when I can get that to help other people that's empowerment for myself because as I always say, I'm about empowerment not the enablement and each one of us have the magic each one of us had the fullness of the universe within us. Not only that is the holographic and we're going to get into numbers because mags great with the numbers as well as many other things in In that holographic connection that we all have and is this mirror of reflection. Basically, the human body is a reflection of the holographic Universe. I believe it said that in a holographic image each little portion of that holographic image has the whole big picture. Now, I believe that we as humans in this case come from one cell yet. It is replicated over and over and over again. That each cell has the Full picture of the whole embodiment of your physical beingness like the metaphysical beingness of communication and connection. It's all one in the more I find myself with in life the more I find the life within myself because it is a direct reflect and the cycles of life. I learn have fun and keep moving. I love the cycles that we tune ourselves to in a conscious State as you are talking about but the natural world Cycles are so important and we just take them for granted we run around and realize that maybe we're more active in the summer and maybe we sleep more on the winter because we don't have as much daylight. We are very much influenced by those if we allow ourselves to be now because of how fast we move in society and are 9 to 5 job is still To be 9 to 5, whether it's winter or summer or spring or fall. We don't necessarily flow like we once did with the seasons and with when the sun was out and when the moon was out so it gets a little bit more complicated because we take ourselves out of a natural Rhythm because of technology which is fantastic because it allows us to do this podcast which we love but then how do we tune ourselves back into the natural Rhythm of the Earth? Because we are dwelling on this beautiful planet and it's got its own Consciousness and its own rhythms and cycles and we're very much influence and can be balanced when we tune into the natural Rhythm of the earth. So we want to make sure that that is something in our conscious State, you know, we always say get grounded or make sure that you're getting fresh air and sunshine and exercise and all of that's because our feet are on the earth and it helps us to nin. It helps us relax in tune. And we are more relaxed as human beings when we connect with nature. When we connect with the natural world even having a conscious awareness of those natural cycles can bring that relaxation to you. So if you're in an office, and you can't get your feet in the dirt, and you're only on concrete, well, if you remember you're on the earth and you're part of the earth and you're part of nature, you can always tune in and realize that you can find a place of relaxation. Ian a place of strength a place that can energize you so that's also super important to keep in mind now as we are, you know, kicking off season 2 of psychic Evolution. I mean we're so excited because it's now in the year 2020 and we love numbers because they just have so much influence over a subtly but yet strongly now when we enter into a new energetic vibration. New cycle we just had kicked off the new year. So we birthed in the New Year. Remember that was the birth cycle of this calendar year. Now as we birth it 2020 is the year, right? So two plus zero plus two plus zero equals 4, so we know the breakdown on a number level is going to resonate with the vibration of a for now real quick for for those of you that don't know numerology very well. I'm just going to cruise through some of the numbers real quick so we can just kind of form that foundation and then let's talk about this year. Okay when you have a number one, it's the birth. Okay. It's the initiation the catalyzation is when you make decisions get things started, right? It's also about the unity and the self because it's just the singular number two you focus on balance you focus on relationships because it's now how do I look at myself as an individual? But what is that? Like when it's based off of other people or other things in my life so that to energy than gives you something outside of yourself to look at yourself with and to experience energy. So to create a balance and create a relationship between one and another think of it like a seesaw, you know, there's always a balance between you and the other person on the other end of that seesaw the energy of three creates creativity. It brings in that Natural Balance of birth life and death of three Cycles. So it brings in a rhythm. It brings in a lot of communication fantastic energy for just getting things moving from a from a place of balance. Okay, because every number is going to build on the number previous. So the two of the balance then flows into the three which then creates the for now when you have the energy of a for and sacred geometry, this is the square so think of this as the foundation of your home all four Is will help you build a foundation give you Roots give you a sense of security. Okay, now once you have a sense of security it then flows into the energy of five which is change because we can build a house, but eventually we realize you know what I've outgrown this and I need to build something new. So the five will bring about change through teachings through issues sometimes lessons, whatever it might be that creates change in your life and then once you work through that Change you'll come back to the place of balance and Harmony into the sixes. Okay, and then you can just kind of find a place of being able to share and integrate and actually partner. Okay, so not just relate to something like the twos do but you're actually going to be partnering which is a blending and an integration. Once you have that you move into the sevens sevens are going to be a number of Mastery and in that Mastery you're mastering the whole cycle. Birth remember so once you birth something then you're in the life stages, you know, the twos threes. The four is five six seven days. This is all the life cycle and lots of different phases. So the birth cycle is one two, three. The life cycle is 4 5 6 and the death cycle begins at 7:00, but really ends at 9 7 8 9 so you have those three 3 & 3 these are the energies of the triple goddess as well. So we'll get into that in another episode. I am sure of it, but But anyway back to our numbers though, 7 creates a level of spirituality where we're connected to a higher Consciousness because of the partnering that we do within ourselves with our higher selves we connect and then we can move into the energy of 8, which is application. This is rewards from all the work that you've done and then we can move right into the 9 which is the ending the completion the fullness returning back home to yourself. So that's just a brief. Of our numbers so going back to 2020. We have two 2s and two zeros when you see a 0 in numerology think of expansion think of the cosmic egg. The all that is was and will be is because that's what 0 is it returns you to an expanded State of Consciousness. So when we have a two and a zero and a two and a zero, we're dealing with balance. Relationships and an expanded way first and foremost within yourself. Okay. So this is why it's so important to understand your cycle. So you can maintain a balanced relationship with yourself. The other 20 of 2020 is balanced relationships and expanded way in all aspects of relationships. So this can be your inner relationships with your children your family your friends your spouse your co-workers. So you are building And relationships this year with yourself and with your community or your loved ones your one-on-one relationships in a new expanded way and what that equals is for the 2 plus 0 plus the 2 plus the 0 equals 4 and what it's doing is it's going to allow you to build a foundation a foundation of relationships inside and outside. So that moving forward as a global family we can consciously have more of a foundation of how we want to be treating each other. How do we want to be in relationship with each other? And how do we want that to look and so think about this as we move into this New Year, we're bringing season to all about relationships in 2020 where we're expanding the relationships with ourselves so we can bring it to you and then expand the relationship with you because that's what it's all about. And then we can come together and really have a Foundation of expanded types of relationships to affect This Global Consciousness that everyone on this planet is experiencing. We all have attuned ourselves two calendar years of 2020 all of us and so well there might be some tribes that don't actually look at calendars, but the majority of human consciousness has attuned ourselves to this vibration think about how you can expand and the other Aspect of that to is about balance, right? So this is why understanding your own Cycles bringing them all into a balance will help your relationship to yourself and help your relationship to others and help build the foundation so that this conscious state of being that we're having on a human race can then expand and evolve to a more conscious State? I think that that's a big thing is the conscious State how you perceive things, you know, because as we're talking about Experience can really mirror in a cosmic experience and as bag was talking about the Seesaw that aspect of right in the middle is the solid part that balances both ends of the spectrum that center part that gives you strength and solidness of life experience to find your rhythm with the other person in life through the ups and downs the different perspectives from the low as we perceive it all the way through to the highest and how do we balance? And counterbalance other people or other circumstances our life experience and yet on a grand Cosmic life experience. It's not easy to go. Oh, it's entertaining and and fun with the ups and downs in life yet. If we present that same dynamic in a more youthful way and little bit more solid in the balance. You're more than likely able to ride those ups and downs with fun with pleasure with maybe a different perspective. When you get off that ride, you didn't go anywhere. You just shifted your position it enough to die. You just shifted your energy to another location and now you've taken that experience of the ups and downs with that entertaining aspect and maybe can go through and have fun with the other kids and and gains and other things to realize it doesn't always have to be a hurting aspect. It can be a balance of life and the interaction with others because of I've found and I'd have found Myself in life not lost myself to it anymore that I found more balance and by finding more balance for myself and finding my own Rhythm my own dance of life. That's all I can do Bongos stand out just by being and doing me and that kind of a connection is just do you you are the magic and life is not happening to you. It's happening because of you every once in a while if I get really really frustrated. I'll sometimes put the analogy of like the seesaw. The teeter totter and in whatever way is the Merry-Go-Round how things go around you've got some stabilized, but you also get a little bit more roundness of that experience and depending on you know, how fast you want to go depends on what horse you want to ride finding your Rhythm and that life experience. And in this case again another mere experience about our day to day living in our Cosmic life. And then this experience on this planet. Maybe it's a reflection of our unified Oneness of life. Ants and we're just adding to those experiences to give us more of who we really are which is everything. We are the universe. We're just expanding and filling ourselves with that knowledge with that experience and can we have some fun along the way does it always have to be a heavy burden to me? I'm going to lighten my load and by helping myself and helping others. I am and it's a consistent and I'm having fun and look we're talking right here right now. So if we're doing this and you're Inning, you know, maybe some to what we're saying because we didn't make you do this you more likely maybe want to maybe a different perspective. Maybe we're kind of entertaining because I amuse myself man, but it's also the ability to have fun with you and how you perceive. It doesn't mean everything's great. And it's hopefully we could do that but being able to maybe have those experiences and see the Rhythm in a natural way kind of like being able to be proactive such as the Bears they know that in the winter time, that's a consistent Rhythm that they're going to go see be seeps and hibernate that time away now, they're warmed their secure their safe and they've able to find the next Rhythm the next fall or season or whatever. It is in a way that they physically know when to get food and where to stay and being proactive because they've now seen a rhythm that now seen a fairly constant pattern that Is the empowerment of the Rhythm of Life you'll find that you'll be able to have a reference of what you're coming from. And if you like something you're going to repeat the process or you go change it because if you like and what you're doing don't change the approach and the approach ain't broke. Don't fix it. It's what works uniquely for you and we'll be right back with some more psychic evolution. Hey there, I'm Jamie Clark and I'm Maggie Norton host of psychic Evolution. We are here to share some great news with you. I've participated in scientific studies as an evidential psychic medium this scientific research at the University of Arizona recently demonstrated that life continues after bodily death to learn more about this amazing technology, visit sulfone dot-org and in 2020.

You can become a member and assist this project for as little as $5 per month to learn. How visit Seoul phone. Dot org forward slash get involved. it's nice to get a little guidance and for me my guidance comes beautifully from my master died Chi very insightful very practical and able to blend that spirituality and quantum physics the aspect of spiritual physics picking that stuff apart getting into the numbers numerology and and other expertise that Maggie As I'm having so much fun sharing this with you and I'm learning along the way as always the ability to make a stronger connection with our Master guide. Keep it simple in the beginning. Let's go for meeting your master guide the ability the insight and the Soul sight of what they can give us and Max going to get into a little bit of that and we'll do some visuals of how to connect with your master guide and keep it simple keep it just the information. If that's what you need, I definitely want to remind our listeners that we do have a couple episodes in season 1 they could check out if they haven't already there's one about the metaphysical senses that help you create a spiritual room and there's one about Spirit guides and one about safety and parameters all those three will help you kind of catch up. If you're not familiar with how to connect with your master guide. There's a nice visual in there that Jamie talks you through so I would Check those out. If you feel like you need a little bit more substance behind this conversation when we're going into 2020 and we're going into expanded relationships to build foundations. It is so important that we realize that all this can do is help us with our psychic relationships. Ultimately. This is where we want to be with each other where we can actually telepathically understand each other without judgment in a place of love and compassion and beauty and just It really kind of tuned in tuned in to where other people are at. Think about how much we communicate in an expanded way when we're really really connected with someone and so think about where you want to take that in your own psychic relationship, but first to yourself remember this goes to the sulfur stand. This is where your master guide and the lessons of the master guy come in so handy because those psychic relationships to our guides and especially It's your master guide that relationship is the one that is with you for life and is guiding you in this life and it's through that guidance that we form a psychic relationship to other aspects of our self and then we can share that with others and then we can understand others and receive psychic information for and about others now. It's through that relationship to your master guide that a lot of that magic happens a lot of the integration of receiving psychic information can happen for us now because we are in expanded relationship this year and building a stronger Foundation. We're going to come back to working with this master guide a lot this year only because it's so important so Jamie and I have put together a couple of exercises that you can do that help you start working with your master guide in a more effective way or just another way to work with your master. And in this particular one, I want to keep it simple like mad was saying go check out the other episodes and you'll be able to make the connections directly with your master guide and as you've already met them and you know other Vibe now, we're going to keep it simple because we'll move from not necessarily having to try to hear the information from your guides, but you're going to be able to see the information from your guides. And so I want you to imagine in your mind site a chalkboard just a very blank. Like chalkboard clean clear and receptive for anything to be on it. Now. This is going to be your master guides Soul board in the beginning your way to connect with your master guide and receive some information and insight more clearly more efficiently more effectively and be able to act on something or not act on something and so in the beginning ask your master guide some yes, and no questions the yes and no is the Answer to those questions keep it simple in any of the questions that you ask. I want you to have an ask your master guide to write down either yes or no in response to the questions that you're asking get a flavor get a feel get a rhythm for how you must regarded as able to work with you and give you some of that Insight because they can do it for us, but they can help giris in guide us into to a way that we could possibly maybe receive more information out of the cycles of life out of that Eternal beingness that we're going to help ourselves as well as help others in being able to do that. You know, keep it simple ask is this a you my master guide but wait a minute. Yep. They see it. I see it on the job board. Perfect. Give it complete faith trust your master guide learning to work with us. That's why I'm saying. Start with a little things first. So it's not a major life-changing. Oh Lord and Lord. I gotta make man just keep it simple and build from there a solid steady consistent base communication. And for instance say you've been feeling. I don't know like a little bit antsy, right you're just glue got a little anxiety or something like that. You can also ask your master guide. Okay. I want to figure out what cycle am I in and you could say hey master god. Am I in this birth cycle? Is that why I'm feeling this energy here or is this part of my life cycle this part of the death cycle, but wait for those yes or knows to appear on the chalkboard because understanding Natural cycles when you start feeling a little anxious or a little antsy or something if you understand. We're on your rhythm you're vibrating then you can say oh my gosh. Well, it's because I'm getting ready to start something new and maybe that's why I'm anxious, you know, because I'm birthing something then you can actually tune yourself in and the next time you feel that way you might be less anxious because you have an awareness of your your birthing something new you're in a cycle of activity and getting something started and that's why you're feeling the way you're feeling a lot of times. We don't have extensive language for our emotions and for our feelings. Sometimes it's because we don't know it's just part of our cycle and if we knew that we would be okay with how we feel I really think that that's an important process. So this exercise that Jamie has given you you can use for all the things we've talked about in this episode. And just say okay. I'm feeling I'm feeling a little bit numb. Am I on a birth cycle? Am I on a life cycle? Am I in the process of a death phase and then allow and again remember death is just Freedom death is just letting go it doesn't mean you're going to die. And that's we're not asking as those questions. But please just remember that. That's what the death is just about letting go you can really understand your cycles and really getting tuned to watch. you feel the way you feel and what aspect of those cycles and that might lead to more yes or no questions from your master guide and the more you do it the better you get the more you trust the better and more fun the experience and being able to learn from those experiences is a big key to wisdom being able to share the knowledge of those experiences and communicate not just talk but communicate with others and talk with them not just to them for Maggie and I we take Take our own medicine. You know, I always say that anything I talk about I can only speak for myself, but I have put it to the test. I do this all day long, but I am always questioning things again. That way you don't go over the edge and To Nuts Veil there over there is a fine line between using your abilities in the crazies. They hearing voices and all that but it's freaking them out. They don't understand what's going on. And if you're uncomfortable with what you're doing others will be uncomfortable. You're competent comfortable. They'll feel confident comfortable. And it's that kind of vibe that you don't hide it they'll feel it. They'll know it and as you're doing this as you're working with your psychic senses in your psychic Evolution the ability to have a team with you to have a guide to have somebody on this journey with you. So that doesn't sometimes feel so alone, you know is like is anyone else doing this? Well, the guy is there can do it for us, but it will do with us he/she. Whatever it is. Whoever it is learning to Vibe with that connection. They'll make it. It as a teamwork, they're here to help them to help themselves and us because it is it's a win-win the cycles of Life another exercise that you can try is create a half circle in your head. And on one side of the half circle is the birth right right above is life. And on the other side is the Letting Go the death you can ask your master guide to Use this like you would see a gauge of mileage of a car say you're going 55 miles an hour think of that gauge when it comes up and it goes through just ask your master guide. Where does this land? Like, where am I cycle with how I feel? Okay, and maybe it'll be right between birth and life. Right? So you're getting ready to just start the cruising phase right? Maybe it'll be between life and death. Which means okay. I'm going to go a little bit internal now because now I have to gather up my energy to go through letting go of something so you can ask yourself those questions, but see a gauge run in a half circle from birth life to death so you can see where you are as you're asking your questions instead of a yes or no is just show me where on the Spectrum am I that can also give you more insight because sometimes you're like right in between the birth. Life or the life and the death or the death and the birth and you can just kind of kind of get a feel for that and that might help give you even more insight into your cycles and the last exercise that we've come up with some of us are not visual. So the chalkboard the yes the know might be a strong point. It might not same thing with the half circle. We might receive information. We might not wear all different when we receive psychic information. So the next thing is get a pen and a piece of paper. And just write down the words that come to your mind. When you ask yourself of what part of the cycle you're experiencing. And then once you figure out your Cycles, then you'll know. Oh when I feel this it's because I'm in this cycle and just keep a track of it. Keep a log of it. This is why Jamie will always encourage you to journal as will. I because once we understand, oh, I always feel that way when I'm in a birth cycle. So that's why I feel it. I always feel anxious or I always feel antsy because I'm getting ready to start something. So the next time I feel that I'm more comfortable with myself, I'm more comfortable with the cycle that I'm experiencing because I've already had an energy read on that cycle. So enjoy these exercises put them to use and see if you can learn more about the cycle of where you are in your life because you're entering into 2020 with so much energy about relationship to self relationship to others and being strong and firm foundations. So do that within yourself and do that with your master guide and then do that with all the beautiful people in your life. And as you work with them and you work with your own abilities, you'll begin to have your psychic Evolution the evolution of your psychic senses the ability to feel your way through life with life for life and about life giving life to your Of Oneness, so we're super happy. You're enjoying season 2 so far of psychic Evolution and we would just want to keep you in mind that we are starting a new life a new cycle as this new year begins, but sometimes it takes a little bit more letting go and we start the cycle a little bit later than others. So give yourself permission to have your own cycle, even though we have influences of outside. Cycles and natural forces you do have your own cycle. So be attuned to that be true to who you are always and find that Rhythm within the evolution of your psychic senses your psychic Evolution and don't forget psychic evolution dotnet is the website to go to and you can tune into all the episodes at anchor dot f m-- forward slash psychic Evolution and stay tuned for More episodes and lots of guests coming this seasons and many surprises we have in store stay tuned.



       "show_5Axr8DL6PjF5aj1GhUpUuv  19w3kg02fo7Q9oyskvn8wL  Hello darling, would you like a drink she'd like something spicy something nasty something really fucking hot something disgusting. Would you like something little pig she likes something really fucking nasty little pig? Oh, yeah. How about a little shot of cock off a little little Phillips van cut for you? You little nasty nasty bitch. Hey, why don't you sit down or poor?Poignant nasty drink, but some black pepper in there put some olive juice. Yeah, maybe a little dry vermouth maybe little more vodka something. I really put a little hair on your fucking chest you nasty nasty peek. Welcome everybody to everybody has their Kink everybody. Has it what everybody has that? What everybody has that? What do you do? Bbbbb Kink today? We're talking about alcohol. There are six main types of alcohol that I'm familiar with. I'm going to list them in order of best to worst best tequila. Number two. Gin number three whiskey number for Brandi number 5 vodka number 6 rum now, I'm not saying that any of those on the bottom don't get my attention once in a while they do but I don't really like rum and vodka is just like for something that's supposed to not have a taste or smell. It has a whole lot of taste. Really nasty nasty smell everybody's like oh he's like rubbing alcohol and I'm like, why are you saying it sexy like that? And whatever here are my thoughts on what if you're drinking here's what you should and shouldn't be doing should. Play a power. Our power hours are Limitless fun. The rules of them are as follows 1 and 1/2 ounce shot of beer or wine something that is in the twelve percent or less range of alcohol. You take a one and a half ounce shot of that every minute for one hour 60 Minutes. That should be seven and a half beers by the end. Also, you can really up the ante if you You can every 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes, whatever your fancy is add in a hard liquor shot and it can really get you going. I think it's a great pregame idea. I think it's a great like afternoon before you go get ready for like a Halloween or a New Year's Eve situation. I think it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of it's not a good time and you don't need a deck of cards. All you need is a YouTube and if you're really ambitious, all you need is a timer and your own playlist and you can just change the song every minute whenever the timer goes off. I think it's great something you shouldn't do Place categories. I think it sucks. I think it's hard to explain to people who never played it before and I think never have I ever is a horrid game. That is it gets really stupid really fast. And there's such like everything is so played and so every never have I ever husband said before so you're like not interesting if you say like never have I ever Then cocaine or something like that, you're not you're not curing cancer with with saying something like that. So step off and avoids categories at all costs actually as a should not you should also not play any games that include cards dwell drinking. I just think it's lame and it also causes you to have to have cards, but I'm not a good card player myself you do what you want to do. It's fine another should but also fits in with a shoe. And they should don't go to the bar until after at least 9:30. You should be pre-gaming if you're going to be going to the bar. If you don't go to the bar to get drunk, then you should be gone by 9:30 because that's an interesting hot take and maybe with a jowl mature and I won't think that but as of right now in this little diary that I'm keeping of mine, that is not a fun priority. If you are going out at 8 o'clock good on you, you're going to run into some people wearing Cardigans people wearing headbands, like just a lot of apparel and also ugly people. So avoid that at all costs. I say if you had simply must go out at 8 o'clock. Don't stay out till bar close. Nobody needs to be in a bar for six hours. I think that that's Really sad so head home at 11:30 when you want and you know, it's perfect. I'll take the Uber to the hub are at 11:30 and then you can take that over home. So maybe if you do that, you should actually contact me because that sounds like a really fun time. another should if you're having a pregame session try to keep it at like 8 or less people because any more than that and people are not going to follow the rules of the pregame. And if you do play a Power Hour, you're going to have people going off to the bathroom in the middle and then I could be taking their shots. And then that's not going to be a bad thing until later you get absolutely wasted and then they're like, why don't know how you got so drunk we drank the same amount and then you're like hmm. What about the Minutes you spent putting on mascara in the bathroom with the door shut and being weird when it was your idea to do the power on the first place. So to avoid like judgment and really annoying people. First of all just be self-aware and see that coming from who you're hanging out with but I know like I've definitely made made the mistake of like inviting a random and being like they're super fun and then they're like super not fun. Also, if you forget booze at somebody's house, it is no longer your booze that is just the rule if I forget a bottle of wine or something at somebody's house or I like especially if it's if it's a full-on bottle and you mention I'll bring it. I'll pick it up tomorrow or something like that. That's fine. But if you have If you like open up a bottle of wine and you have like a third of it left don't text them in four days and be like hey, do you still have my bottle of whatever left because guaranteed either it's been thrown in the garbage or somebody's drank it. Nobody's hanging onto your one third bottle of wine that same goes with just consider it a a you're paying for the venue to have the pregame at if you leave like five or six beers or something like that. Now, of course, there's exceptions to the rules of it's an extraneous amount of alcohol or if maybe you're going to that person's house the next weekend. It should be in Commerce common courtesy that this person does not drink all of your alcohol, but do not expect anyone to hang on and be the gatekeeper of alcohol that you could not take care of yourself. It's like a neglected dog if you don't take Care of your half a bottle of tequila and somebody willing owner is willing to take care of your bottle of tequila, then accept it as a blessing and give away your rights and say nothing about it. Let spread the love and do not try to take back your shit. It's not yours anymore smoking cigarettes with alcohol is fun and also cool so bottom line cut and dry anybody who doesn't think that I'm about to say smoking weed and drinking is also very cool. If you're not a person who enjoys weed or Gets behind it. Just remember how much how great you think it is to smoke cigarettes and drink and then imagine that person enjoying it 10 times more and then you can just sit in your own thoughts and be like wow, actually. Yeah if they're having that much fun. How am I going to be a sourpuss about it? If somebody likes to masturbate when they're drunk that is actually problematic as fuck especially publicly and I haven't ran into that very much. Talking to people you don't know out at the bar is complicated because you need to be there's a fine line between talking to people at the bar and ignoring your friends and I've definitely ridden this line a hundred times and it is not something that is easily finessed alone. What you have to do is you have to take for my experience. You have to gauge the personalities of people you're engaging at the bar. And you have to see if they're going to be somebody who is willing to make a larger group or if they are only seeking one you have to try to combine the groups. And if you're get a Vibe within an instant that it doesn't work, then it's over. It's like when you introduce a friend to like a boyfriend or something if the vibe is not there if the vibe is killing you you in it with a significant other you're going to make it very difficult for the rest of your life. With the in the case of a stranger at a bar, you're going to just make your night very difficult and your friends will talk shit behind your back whether or not they say they do let's see what else shots at. A bar is fun. But expensive bring a flask. I think that that is a gold the golden rule bring a flask have girlfriends with purses. I think it's really nice. Even a lot of girls get away with flasks in their purses I feel so Let It Go Let It Be otherwise figure out your own ways to finesse alcohol into a bar even if it's just putting a shooter deep down in your pocket, I think that that's fine or in your underwear or something it's a great way to save money and it's a great way to have a lot of fun and meet a lot of cool people in a bathroom do go to the bathroom when you're at a bar you can meet some of the coolest people in the bathroom and also you can avoid peeing your pants If peeing your pants is something you do I can relate to that very hard and I'm sorry but that is just a reality you will have to deal with for the rest of your life because what it means is is it's not your you truly pee your pants and you PA bed. There's a difference between doing that and then getting out of bed and peeing other places that is not something I can relate to but when you're taking too much alcohol and to the point that you have to pass out all of that liquid will catch up to you. Your body will not be strong enough to wake your heavy heavy ass up and your body will just give in to the pain of holding that much urine and you will be her pants and it will continue forever. Even when you think like, oh, I haven't done it for six months. That just means you haven't drank like you did six months ago. That's all that means. Having sex while drunk is a terrible idea and it is also you're not giving anybody consent. But if you guys are already dating then I think it's fine and it's also kind of fun and you can also take stupid pictures and send them to people and be embarrassed Instagram live is reserved for people who are either extremely annoying or Shit-faced and extremely annoying. So for me I get on the grill Instagram live and if I'm on Instagram live, then you know that I have real deep-seated problems that day like because that is not something that I want for myself and it is not something that I need other people to see which thank God typically not many people will watch the whole thing. And usually there's only two or three people watching at one time. Thank fucking god. What else is a really good some really good do's and don'ts I mean, I'm not sure you have another good do is when you're ordering your food at the end of the night where during double so if you're getting like a sub order to subs and then get one for the next day because there's something really beautiful about food in the fridge. That is like really really nice the next day. Also, you are allowed to drink like an adult I was against this for a very long time, but I think as long as you're still going out, you're still ripping it. I think it's it's completely fine to be drinking water in the night. If you're really concerned about that. Also getting a good meal beforehand. I used to be a firm believer in don't eat a lot so you could drink a lot but I think it backfires on a lot of people because they get very sick. So if you're somebody who gets sick when you're drinking you have to look into ways to make sure that you don't do that because being sick like being sick and drinking is it's a real it's an issue because sometimes it's like you're sick, but you're you're still willing to go like your you throw up and then you like laughing and then you can like still take shots. That's very fun. And that's leads to very hilarious videos. That will not be funny in 20 years. But if you're really sick to the point that you like are going to be out for a day or two or you're going to beat you like Go out at night. Then you have to like really research ways to you know combat that or like get invest into some anti antacids or some Pepto-Bismol or something like that get into a ritual of taking like aspirin before bed or something like that. There's a lot of people who don't like the idea of aspirin because they're like, it hurts your liver if you like take that with alcohol but like alcohol so hurts your liver so you really have to like You have to think like what I rather just hurt my level liver a little more and not have a blistering headache at when I when I wake myself up at 6:30 in the morning or whatever. Also, I personally believe in anbd D NB know how is it? Be DND type of philosophy which is binge drink or no drink if you're somebody who's even worried about like being unhealthy and stuff like that and you do find yourself like drinking a lot. Keeping an attitude of b d and e is going to help you remain cool and popular but it's also going to make you look like you don't have a problem. So for example, when you know, you've earned an opportunity, I mean you've earned the reputation of being somebody who's always going to drink who's always down for fun who's always down for this. It's actually really fun to surprise. I've noticed recently. It's really fun to surprise people and Talk them into being like Oh, no. Yeah, I don't need a beer. No, I'm not drinking. I'm not gonna drink tonight because we're not going to get drunk are we? Oh, well, then yeah, that's fine. I'll just like water. Oh, I'll just have like a Coke know like you guys can drink. Yeah. I have your few beers. That's fine. I just when I'm drinking I don't I don't need like there's a few beers is not something fun to me like alcohol is not something like I would rather just come out and do the drink a beer so When and people will some people will think you have a problem if they see you just binge drinking and blacking out whenever you drink but you need you have to just reassure them that like you don't need that and you you could just drink twice a month once a month or whatever and just get fucked up and that is completely fine with you but people will be surprised when they've already labeled you as a drunk and you are like no, it's fine. I'll just take water maybe add a little lemon and they'll shit in Libya. Why why aren't you drinking and then you have to really look at them and you have to think like is this someone that I value as a person as a friend because when I do get fucked up then they're like, oh we have a problem. Like you're not fun. You become somebody we don't like the law but then when you aren't drinking then they're like why aren't you drinking? Well, but why well, okay, you're no fun. And if you have people like that in your life like you really need to cut them out and I'm basically speaking of myself right now. So I have to I have an Instagram to go through if that makes sense. You just a side note about something fun to do. If you like going Instagram any give herself a goal, like I'm going to unfollow 10 people no matter what no matter what I'm unfollowing 10, and it doesn't mean I have to unfollow them forever. I could fall tree follow them in a week or so, but or like if you have to like cut some people that you didn't necessarily want to it's a really fun thing to do to go on your Instagram or your Twitter or whatever and be like I am going to go through the list of people in following and I'm cutting out 10 and you'll be surprised how easy it is and how cool And find it is and also unless they have like apps because they're like neurotic and Psychopathic. No one's even going to know that you unfollowed them. The only tricky part is is when you unfollow somebody who has a private page and then you're like, oh fuck now if I want to re follow them I have to I have to like get accepted to do that. But just remember even if you didn't have to get accepted they still are going to get a notification that you re followed them. So Either way, you're going to kind of look like an asshole which is fine. Okay. What am I let me add here. I feel like I've just been yada yada yada eating. What the fuck? Oh, here we go. Okay. Well, those are my beautiful alcohol takes. Those are my like hot takes on drinking and alcohol on whatever. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you found any of it useful some advice maybe or maybe you heard some things that you're like I completely disagree with that your you're actually crazy or whatever and To that. I say feel free to DM me at Trevor way Louis on Instagram. I love to hear all your shit. I think it's fun and I'll fight with you. I don't give a shit. I think it's great. So anyway I have a really fun Labor Day weekend. And how did I start this and I start this being like doing like a Sophie as a slut impression like very like nasty fucking pig. Yeah, something like that. So talk to you later. You nastya. Nastya fucking nasty dirty Pig. Where could it be? Where is it going? I'm pulling so hard this court could snack. How will I explain? My mother cannot know cannot know I'm putting things in life. This is no this cannot be I'm going hard but I'm feeling the vibrations in my chest. I wanted out how could I put it in them only 10 or 11 years old, but I thought it would feel it seen it in some porn and the dildo in my parents room didn't If it I want it out this can't be real. I didn't even mean to put it in. I thought my mother's bullet would be safe because it's little but now because I clenched it soaring like a rocket up to my stomach the cord from the controller is flying in my ass like a kite. I'm almost out of string this must have a good two feet in slack. So now and yanking him Anak for I'm pulling it out for what feels like days and challenge you and her a vibrating still thumb is fucking me every which way I can't let it give any more so I pull and I he even a scream and it leaves I've now covered it in shit. Don't worry. I'm washing all over it. But thinking back I should have washed it more. I'm sorry Mama for the impending infection, but I can't reveal the truth about your toy for now. We are sisters in this vibrating acting even though scary even though the situation got a little hairy. There was a part of me that needed more. I'm sorry. Your little boy is such a I'm sorry Mama. I should have to put your bullet in my eyes. Scared me to death. I covered it shit herbs are be please forgive me. And if any of you tell the story to my mom, I'll kill you. Okay, I'm going to try to make this as like light and not crazy as possible if that's possible. But basically I have been attempting to bottom again. And ow, ow. Ow, they they do not get the fucking recognition they deserve. But I have like I have a curse some would say it's a blessing and I say it's a curse that for some reason people who I like I like or whatever it always. Basically if I'm into somebody just know if you're like a big dick person just know to run for them because there's I have something of a sixth sense that I wish I didn't for that and I don't and I don't like that like I want to be I want to be with the most average of Jose. Like I really do I would love that. So basically the person who I'm with is like just doing the most okay and I mean it is fair. It is fair for them to get a turn and I'm like, okay, so I was just a little drunk and like just to just to kind of paint the scene of like what what had happened was I was a little drunk there wasn't a lot of lube left tried some different positions to figure this shit out and I was like not in the mood or ready and there was literally no like foreplay. Lead up. It was just kind of like make out lets, you know gets too fucking and basically when it was happening, I was like fate I was like belly down which I feel like is the worst way to like he's into it for sure because it's like it you get no control and my gravity works against you so I took my big deep my big deep nice bottom breath and then I was impaled and I was crushed and I was nearly killed and I had to you know, stop the whole thing and then he was like Just relax just like she should just facts and I was like, well basically shaking him strangling him being like this can't happen. I'm not ready and I need to I need to like get right I need to like practice. So I went into full Rocky mode lately and I've been like okay, I need to like basically like instead of getting in shape. I need to like figure out a way to you know, make it okay for me to stick. Basically Coke bottles and cans of beer just in my asshole which kind of crazy that this is like the story. I'm telling right after I sang the song about whatever but it's just not it's not my jam. It's not my jam, but I'll try to make it work. So I've been like looking around my house for different like objects because I don't have anything like that's just like immediately would make you think oh, that would be great item and I need it to be something that kind of has a A base because like I was saying in the songs in it went in the song like when I put that bullet in like it was literally like you're fucking going fishing and then the real like all of the line is like going down is like some shit was shooting up into me so crazy. So I know that I have like a powerful clients like could like You know tear flesh right off. So I was like, I need something with a base because I cannot risk living in a village and having something really really far up there. So option number one. I was I was doing using a bike pump not a bike pump that you're picturing like where you put your feet down and you're like pumping with your hands. No, it's like a it's like a one. It's like a just a one piece and you you can just do with your two. You don't like it is not as big as you're making his own making it picture your head. So first it was that but then I was like this is too thin because like I need I need the thing is about I think about a and all that like nobody talks about it doesn't really make the length really doesn't matter at a certain point the link will matter because you will be you will hit like the Which part of the colon is that? I'm not a saint. No, I'm not sure but it's it's the it's the last part of the: 'I will like hit the wall there eventually because it is not just a straight. It's not just a straight Avenue So eventually it length will matter but I don't think in to mentally too many people like will fit that bill in the world. So really the girth is the problem. It's like when you have a giant shit and like you're used to your normal shit's there's your shit. There's your shit there's your shit and they're all kind of the same size and And then you'll have like the time when you like shit something out and you're like well damn that was like really stressful and hard for me. And so you have to kind of prepare for that to be your new normal. And so I was like, well this won't work. So then I found something that was actually the perfect size but it was the base of a chef's knife. And so I was like well, maybe if I like rap the chef's knife blade part with like some clothing or something like that then like that that part will never have to Go in but then I just summary some reason I just pictured like something going wrong. Like I don't know like a gust of wind coming and then like I like clenched or something and then I like basically suck a chef knives chef's knife up my ass. So I'm like, no, I'm not doing that because like I don't need to be sliced and diced like that not no way and So then I was like, oh my God here. It is the Holy Grail and it is a hammer. Hear me hear what I'm saying? It is a hammer. So not not the hammer side obviously, but like the base. I'm still finessing it. I'm still like working. We're working together. We're like, we're under negotiations were like, we've had a few meetings together. We like we weren't sure exactly the time and place but basically what I'm getting at and I don't know why I thought this was necessary to tell however, many people but I'm basically I'm showing I'm telling you what I'm doing for for someone I care about and this is why you should really value if I like you or if I really care about you you really should value that because what I do for people I care about it's to the level of that. I will figure out a way I will put a condom on a hammer and I will sit in my Hut In a rural Village sweating on my hot bed with no lights and I will try to finesse. With my Johnson & Johnson baby aqueous cream. I will try to finesse a hammer into my ass. Just just so that someone else can have fun now. Like I said, I have not been successful yet, but I will get there and hopefully I never update you because I don't know what kind of heat stroke induced like psychosis. I'm dealing with that. I am sharing this but Basically pray for me and think about me and I understand that I'm sick and fucked up and yeah and be thankful that I really I was able to decide not to do the the knife because now that I'm saying the night like in my head when I didn't say it out loud the knife was not crazy. I just need you to know that it wasn't crazy then once I said it out loud I was like, oh like I've actually snapped because the knife. like putting it putting the base of chef's knife in is like Holy fuck, that's sick. So anyway, thanks. okay, I don't know why I'm going on so many parts in this episode, but my friend suggested that I tell like an awkward story and I was like trying to think of something in my life. That was like so awkward or like uncomfortable and I really and I remembered this so basically not going to name any names here because I don't know who is listening but there was this group of boys that I hung out with not very often, but we would play Call of Duty together at one at this kids house. And it went on for years like years and basically like the house was so nice and so fun and cool and like the way it was set up was the like the data I think built the house himself like not all himself, but like he designed it and he was like what it doing work on. It was like maybe his brother or something. I don't know but like basically they hadn't had it didn't look like contract house, but the house was like really really nice and it was like very big and like the downstairs was just the it was like this huge huge living room like you walk down the stairs and you entered this huge living room very very open and like one corner was like the first part of it was like all open space and then I had like a it had like a huge like window because the way it looked like from the road the house looked like kind of just like a small house, but then on the other side basically the basically one side of the house the The basement was underground and then the other side of the house the basement was like, 'I had you could like go outside and stuff. So it was like really cool. It's kind of built on a hill. And anyway, just whatever. It doesn't even matter. That was nice, but the parents were super cool and super nice and the this is like my first time spending the night at his house. Maybe I was like 13 14 at this point and it was like the first of many many times but He was a really really quiet kid. The this kid was like super quiet and let's just call him. This is call him Drew. Okay, so Drew is super quiet and like at school and shit and was like kind of a nerd but like not really nerdy just kind of like a pariah and so But when he was at his house like just right off the bat. He like already was weird and was already like crazy town crazy. And he liked was so mean to his parents. Like I shade my parents but it is shade is out of love like it is not like he would be like, whiny and like his mom would say. Hey, it's it's time for blah blah blah and he'd be like, I'm coming God you're embarrassing forget embarrassing and it would be it was like that kind of stuff. It was so freaking weird. And so I was like, oh my I'd like I want to eat like and we got and she made Stromboli which to this day. She's it's the only Stromboli I've had was her Stromboli, but it's so fucking good. If you can get your hands on some Stromboli in your life. It was so fucking good and it was like homemade and shoot made like homemade Velveeta mac and cheese which you know, a lot of people don't like Velveeta bit. Like I love it also fun fact about Velveeta invented by Pabst Blue Ribbon and during the prohibition and then they sold it to craft when the prohibition was over. I'm just I know Colfax like that got it. So then the crate so think with the craziest shit started happening. So well at this time I was participating in like how do I say that? So this was the time when I edit I think I've talked about it, but maybe I haven't but like I was participate I was like basically pleasuring this other boy who was like in the in the group but like definitely it was not well known at all. But so when we were figuring out the sleeping situation for the night, so it was getting it was getting to the point where we were figure out the sleeping situation. And so the dad like put together like this whole like he He was like straight. Basically. I told you that he built the house because I just needed you to know that he's a crafty as fuck. So he's putting together this whole canopy like like Fort kind of situation which we were a little old for but it was still kind of cool and he was putting it putting it together and like putting all these like cushions and blankets and like just pillows like all together and it was like really fun and I was like, oh my God this like cool and like my dad would never like do this like my dad like laughs and talks about like cheeseburger cheeseburger flavored toothpaste and I'm like, I literally want to drop that and so he's putting this for together and shit and I'm like, oh my God see me so fun and so cool. And also I was like in my head like this is going to give us so much privacy so that I can like get my DS tonight. And basically it came to nighttime and He was in the dad was like all right boys like lets you know, let's let's shut off the games pretty soon. It was like it was pretty late. It was like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. He's like, let's shut up the games pretty soon because we really probably being loud and like making it, you know, making a bunch of noise and like, you know being like sniped him sniped, you know saying stupid gaming set. So we were probably annoying as fuck and he was like, all right guys, like let's switch it off. Let's go to bed or whatever and then Drew. I was like Marijuana, I don't want all this stuff and then the dad came down. It was just kind of like Jo like eat like you really can't talk to me that way and stuff like that and I was like, this is Juicy as fuck. But also like I wanted to die and I was like so awkward because that's not the awkward situation. By the way. I didn't tell this whole shit just just for this part, but basically he was like it was like awkward. It's always awkward when there's a confrontation between like I think it was last week when I talked about shooting like the kid in the face. the I like thing the song about shooting the kid in the face with the with the airsoft gun, like when his parents like were like yelling at him and his dad like pulled it down his bare ass and expect his brass and stuff that that was like very awkward for me, of course, so I don't like confrontation between when your friend your friend and the parent because also you don't know which side to be on because it's like the parent could send your ass home anytime but also the kid is like I mean that's front so you don't really know what to do. It's a very awkward terrible situation to be in and as a parent, I don't know what I would do. I don't know if I'd call my kid out be like you were being a little cunt right now or if I would be like like I don't want this like I want I want my kid to seem cool like this they talk back to their parents or some shit. So anyway, they're having this little discussion. Anyway, then then I drew heads like what Stomps off to his bedroom and then me and the other two kids are like looking at each other like Fuck and to get some self-respect of his dad follows him and then we just hear him crying your am I crying so me and one of the boys like go up to the door and we're like literally, you know, like glass against the wall, like fucking listening and for everything and he's like, hey, dude, I don't want to sleep with them. I don't want to leak I was going to say bad. It's weird. It's weird that's freaking weird like saying like he went to sleep in the same bed as I switch. It wasn't even the same bad it was Like there was one air mattress that was like a double decker air mattress and that was reserved for me and my little wanker and then the other two spots one was like a pillow thing and then one was like these couch cushions that were fastened passing in a way that like looked nice. I mean all of the Physicians were pretty comfortable, but he said he was like, I almost lose dude who's like going crazy and you could tell he was like bawling and he were like, oh my God, it's so weird. And then the dad was like Drew this is like don't be like this. Don't be like this. This is your friends your friends let in and he was like he was like, oh, I don't want to do it. It's gay. It's freaking gay gay and I was like, oh my God, I was like what's happening here? Like it was getting insane. So anyway, then we were almost caught fucking sneaky listening in but then Drew came out and was like fucking obviously had had just been balling. It is like red red is like The reddest eyes ever ever ever and then we all like basically were like dead silent for the rest of the night ended up staying up the whole night. Nobody even went into the the fort. Well, I think one of the kids went before but like all of us ended up staying up all night. No sleep and then we were like, oh, we're not gonna sleep at all when I was little and then the next morning it was like 10 a.m. And we're like, okay, let's lick sleep for like 20 minutes and the mom was like I'm making homemade pizza or something like that like, really nice and she's like I'm making homemade pizza and then But like okay just all like before I even go on just like just put yourself in my shoes yourself in my shoes. Now. I spent a whole night with this kid who would like basically was like, it's forget. It's good. It's weird. It was somebody much weird. It was like bawling. I had to like now spend from like 1:00 a.m. To 10 a.m. With this freaking kid after being like basically shaded, you know, not that he know but also like just it was freaking weird cuz we all like know each other and It's not like we were all laying on top of each other like it was so innocent. It was like what is this? It was just it was just like oh bath like and also it really revealed a lot about him because he was like so quiet at school. Anyway, so the next day we sleep like 20 minutes this isn't even interesting. But if this is just like a relatable like when you go to sleep over time a moment, but you we then we're like, let's just leave like 20 minutes because we were all dying like actually dying and we slippers 20 minutes or so. 20 30 minutes Lord knows but then the moms like pizza is ready pizza's ready. So we all like pop up and we all have like little just blood coming out of our eyeballs because we're so fucking tired and then we go upstairs and I am so exhausted that I'm not even thinking and I am like eating all of this pizza. I think we all are but we like eating all of it without even like letting it cool down and it is so blazing blazing hot that I just remember being like like that's how I was And it was like I was a little bit small coming on and off and then freaking later on in the day. My mother took us to because this town nearby data that has the movie theater had free movies every Saturday between Thanksgiving and Christmas which it would be like a movie that premiered like within the last year. So it was like not a new movie but like they had like a free movie. So then my mother would take us to that to the movies we liked it. I happen to be a movie that I wanted to see so then we ended up going to that and motherfucker. I was so dead tired and then I was like eating popcorn in the theater and I was like, oh my God, like the popcorn keep sticking to the roof of my mouth like my God, it's crazy. And I was like, you don't get exhausted. Well, I started to realize it wasn't popcorn on the top of my mouth. It was literal like dangling bits of my the top of the roof of my mouth. Am I not move my mouth was so numb from being burned because I had burnt it. So bad on the cheese from the pizza that I literally had dangling pieces of like raw skin hanging from my mouth that felt like a little kernels of popcorn like because they were just like blisters of oh, I like this picture like hard fucking burn blisters on the top of your mouth bitch my mouth hurts. So fucking bad for like the rest of the week like just like a cautionary tale. It's like, you know, when people are like fucking pizza rolls like cold on the outside then scalding hot in the middle. Well this ship Is just scalding hot all around and I was just chomping it like it was gum. I mean it was insane. So basically that was like one of the more uncomfortable situations. I was at like at a friend's house. It was really like fucking it was just so fucking weird and I never looked at him the same but I would still go to his house for years, but I was like God like What a little psycho. I mean he really got over it. But like I was like what a little psycho. So basically it's like kind of like you have to like socialize your dogs and stuff that you have to like make sure your dogs like see other people and see other animals and stuff. So they don't get like weird you have to do the same thing with your kids and he was like the firstborn. So like maybe he just like didn't he didn't get like associated with kids and stuff. So he was like really weird about his own space like he had his own room his own space pretty much the whole basement the whole basement was just where the kids slept. And they each have their own room. So it was like maybe that's what it was. Like it just was like he just couldn't share things. It was freaking weird. Anyway, I think I fucking gone on and off.





       "                             4950bU9ol4bovqoKfBDcIk  Hello, welcome back to everyone has their Kink. Thank you so much for all the kind words last week. That was super nice. I made sure I let nobody tell me any critiques but to be fair there were some really really nice things that so it motivated me to keep doing this. I will release episodes every Sunday, so don't worry about that and I will update everyone on Instagram. What?At Trevor Lewis Trevor wait Luis. Oh God plugging myself about when it's going to be released on other platforms right now. The most popular ones are Spotify Google Cast Pocket Casts. Otherwise, we're still it's kind of just waiting on Apple but very exciting. So this week I'd what didn't really know what to I mean, I never I don't think I'm ever going to know what I'm going to talk. talk about until I get a little inspired and I was inspired after I received a text today from my mother that It was pictures of four pairs of underwear that she said she was going to send me that she bought at the garage sale. They were 50 cents each. She talked them down to 25 cents each there were five in the set. But she said one had a whole so she didn't get that one, but I just need you to hear what I'm saying, my mother. Without asking bought me four pairs of underwear for a dollar at a garage sale. Also the hilarious part about it is I said are they mediums I said are they mediums and she goes two of them are two of them are a large, but it's fine. They were a quarter. So yeah, so I'm going to receive underwear that aren't even my size which is hysterical. But this got me thinking about garage sales and what an impact they were on my entire life amazing and what and I have some really good garage sale shit to say okay for like maybe the last let me just think of let me tell you about my earliest memory of abroad so my earliest memory of a garage sale was my mother and her real real bitch friend Denise who she's not friends with anymore, but she was like a big smoker and she was like super skinny and she was surreal hag and she they got together and they did a garage sale and I ended up spending a lot of my own money on Denise's stuffed animals from her like kids who had got a who are like out of the house. And she was selling a lot of stuffed animals and I as like an eight-year-old was putting like my $10 in there, you know to get to buy a bunch of these 50 Cent stuffed animals that I certainly didn't need, but I'm like looking back. I'm like Denise is a real a fucking bitch because why did she not give me those stuffed animals for free was her friend's son and I was young like I shouldn't be paying for these stuffed animals like if this kid wants his stuff animals. Give them to him. What a bitch. Anyway at that same garage sale this Girl Rebecca her last name rhymes with Arsenio. So if people who are listening know who this is, but she got attacked by our German Shepherd dog named Heidi Heidi ended up dying a couple years later because she was addicted to eating cat litter But anyway, I just remember I went into the basement and with all of my with my hall was like a Santa sack full of these fucking stuffed animals and I was like Rebecca you want to see my toy box, which my toy box was just this giant like computer box, like what a computer came in and it was like literally massive. It was like 5 feet by 5 feet and it was just this cardboard box that I just threw stuffed animals in and then when Wood and if we kept it in the basement, we had like a wet basement. Not important, but like basically just set the scene. It was wood paneled walls in the basement with always a wet floor every year flooded the it smelled like mildew it's over now, but like it was like a whole thing. It was always like a two-day like in the spring when the snow would melt. It was always like a two-day shopvac like family bonding time where they were to shop vacs and and then people would be moving furniture and it was like was kind of like a bonding moment, but it was also like a beautiful time. For my parents to be really frustrated with each other and like really lash out and like didn't they didn't save like the the bad words for like behind closed doors, like know they like we knew that their marriage was falling apart as children, which was nice because knowing that they're still together. I'm like, wow that is like real compromise and that is real commitment. That's amazing. But I would get into this toy box like I would literally like Lift myself up and then just kind of like horizontally roll into the toy box and just kind of seep in like it was a fucking we call those like a at a Play Place those ball pits. Yeah. It was like a ball pit but it was stuffed animal pit and there was one doll that was called like a best friend all or something like that. It was something or it was like my first pal or something like that. My brother had it my older brother and it was like based is it was the doll that Chucky was based on I'm just saying so picture wet basement wood-paneled. You know, the lighting is wasn't great. All the windows were like those cinder block windows barely any light in and here I am diving into these this bucket O stuffed animals with fucking Chucky in there. I mean just like to paint a picture so I had some fucking Kahuna's back in the day to get in that ball pit, but I just, you know, alley-oop those fucking news. Stuffed animals right into the box to never look at them again. Also, if you if you stepped in there, you would most certainly either impale your foot with a Barbie arm or like step in some kind of Squish that you like don't know what it is. And then you find out like a year later that it was like some kind of slime gak that you got from like a Nickelodeon box and you're like, it's like fucked up and it like fucked up a toy. Just also a side note about my stuffed animals. I used to like truly think that I was like a hair stylist. So I would completely make over my stuffed animals and by that. I mean basically shave them bald with a scissors and then stick them in and then like douse them because we had like the squirter bottle, you know for like your hair and I would douse the fuckers just douse them. I mean till they were soaking wet like like they would at the salon and then I just comb their hair and shit just calm it and then I'd cut it and I'd like pretend to trim. But I would do it, you know every like a few days. So before you knew it, every animal didn't have hair and if it was like it was like a person looking doll, then it was really fucked. I mean it was like definitely pick see all the way everyone looked like a dyke. It was fabulous very telling for how things ended up. But if they did have like hair that I would keep on the head like there was this Lion in particular. Because after I would douse them, I didn't have obviously like a hair drying station for them. But I knew they couldn't just stay wet because I know what that did to the basement and I know that smell is not something that I wanted all my best friend's to smell like so I would shove them all in the dryer crank up the dryer to about 75 minutes, which was the max because a child does not know what to do with the dryer and I was left home a lot alone. So I I had a lot of time on my hands to work a dryer. So I would jack up the dryer throw a couple dryer sheets and get them real smelling good and then they'd all come out with perms. So it was really nice. Everybody got a makeover, which was basically either a perm or like a real like pixie cut that did nobody any favors like Loonette and Molly from Big Comfy Couch. I don't know if you're familiar with that show, but as a child, it was like my shit 10-second clean up. I would literally trash the living room. Like just flip Furniture, you know spill shit on the floor and I would just be like, oh my God, it's about 10 seconds. It's almost 10 second cleanup time. So I'd spill a bunch of shit. And then I would like once 10-second. I would like just go ramp it like a little meth kid and just pick up shit because that would that was for some reason fun, but Lunette had gorgeous pigtails with this thick black hair and I just caught him right off and then Molly had She had yarn hair because even in the show Molly was a doll Lynette was a person in the show and Loonette and Molly had bangs and like I believe that I may have been like like this was 98. So I maybe I was I must have been influenced but I was like definitely giving some real real New Age rocker chick blunt bangs to Molly and then Molly just got the chop, and she looked Really horrible for it it gave her a double chin. I don't understand that but back to Rebecca. So we go downstairs. I got my hall of fucking twice. I open the door and Heidi are German Shepherd just pins are up against the wall starts barking at our starts barking at her is like biting her but not biting her like kind of just like putting her teeth on her skin like bitch. I could fucking get take you at the jugular now. It was so scary. Scary so scary but you know looking back. I'm like she was such a protector, you know, all my other dog's in the future were always just like They would maybe look me in but never they're not like they're not Killers honestly, so it was like really nice to have such a protective dog. But then like I say, she she was very poisoned by like all the cat piss and shit. She was like huffing in the basement but garage sales so then cut two later in life. I mean, I was like living garage sale life and you know, how like there's I feel like there were kids because like I would go to His house, especially there was one kid in particular who I would go to his house and his mom would like pick up some clothes at a garage sale and he would be like these clothes are so gay. These clothes are so ugly. I can't wear this. This looks terrible like all this shit. Not me baby. If is same thing with Christmas when kids were like bitching about getting clothes for Christmas. I was like obsessed. I was like, yes make every single thing closed because like it was not common for me to get like new clothes. Those because also I was like gaining weight like nobody's absolute business and my brother was thin and he was five years older but I remember like because I knew I was going to get his hand me downs. There would be like a pair of jeans. Like there was this pair of junko jeans that I remember that had like a frog on him and I was obsessed with them. I was obsessed with them, but they were like too big for me and I remember like actively When I was eating like some time not every time but sometimes I was be eating and I would be thinking like if you keep like just keep eating and you'll be able to wear those junko jeans with the Frog because like they'll fit you and they'll be your jeans. I mean, obviously they'll be rolled at the bottom like 18 times, which is was my style until like eighth grade, but I loved getting a hammy down like because it wasn't like a hand-me-down from Years ago it was like still on Trend. It was like six months later. I was like catching his ass catching his ass because my love handles were on something. I don't know back in the day. They were on some fucking Fierce and I could like I could get also elastic waistbands for boxers. So I would just go in his drawer. I don't know why like, why was I not comfortable with my own fucking underwear, but I was like these underwear cooler than mine. These are like turquoise. And so then I would like where I'm gonna be like, They're only like a lonely a little bit longer in this elastics going to be like so perfect. I me I wanted to be fatter. If only I knew the damage that I was doing like just eating like pizza rolls and ice cream sandwiches. Like it was nobody's business and like 500 end of the day. Okay, that's a whole that's a whole other story that I've told about a billion times, but There was a time in my childhood where we had a free range on pop. We really like we could just go all the fucking out on any soda. We wanted and one in my mother was like an extreme couponer for like a few years. So it didn't even really affect her because at the time Minnesota allowed you to do double coupons. So this woman was getting like 12 packs of pop for 20 cents. I don't even know some some insane amount and So, I mean we just had we had like my dad's Gun Room, which was half Gun Room where he would like make black-powder bullets shit like that. And the other half was literally just like a Game of Thrones like sword seat, but of fucking 12-packs of pop like the ones you could stick in your fridge and they had like that thing that you could just pull it out and then it was like supposed to give you like one pop at a time and and there was a time where we were put on a limit of five a day and I remember me and my brother were we like It was like probably one of the first times I thought like my mom is a bitch. She's a bitch. This is like bullshit that she like five pops is ridiculous. And then I remember there's this kid Adam sell of who I was like bitching at school. I was like, yeah, my mom was willing to let me have five pops a day now, which also I'm looking back. I'm like, I don't even think I could drink five Bots. I mean I could but I'm like, I was literally getting home at like 3:30 in the afternoon and I was in Bad probably it's by 10:30 in seven hours. I thought five pops was like bullshit, which is so insane to me. I'm like that just shows like what the number must have been before like insanity and I remember I was bitching Adams out. Laugh at himself was like I only get one pop up month and I was like, wow your parents like really hate you and also he was like weird as fuck. So Adam if you're listening, which I know you are, but sorry you were weird and then your little brother was rude to and your whole family's weird. Okay, and his dad was the principal and is what his mom was the social worker let that sink in for a second. He complete he was on the Spectrum some way. I don't know. I mean, you know, hey live your life but like nobody like the call was coming from inside the house and nobody in the house was answering. Nobody was everyone was looking at that family, like maybe consider like a option for him to get out some energy to put it nicely and nobody was nobody was doing that. So I'd love to know where he is today. I hear he's buff which via that amount of energy I would be I'm glad showing. Garage saling is fabulous. So fun. I like to even even the shit. I know I would never like want I'll go through like kids clothes. I even like to go through kids clothes it's weird, but that's just the example. I was thinking of this plenty of other shit that I would never buy that I like to look at and but you know, what fascinates me is people who have got shells and we all know one especially if you're from a small town people have the same garage sale every year and then you see The same shit over and over and over because they're asking for literally ridiculous prices like oh my God, I really was bargaining with this bitch one time for these four cereal bowls. One was Tony. The Tiger one was fucking I don't even know there was like a frog okay, and he was like a cereal guy and then there was snap crackle and pop a Serial person and then there's a fourth character that I don't remember maybe Captain Crunch. I'm not sure but they were these for cereal bars with for matching spoons and they were like really nice big porcelain cereal bowls with pictures on them. And this woman wanted 20 fucking dollars for cereal walls. I'm like if you want $20 for the series will put them back in your cupboard if you're so obsessed with them and that's how I feel about a lot of things that about you you have to like be a garage sale to me is like if the shit doesn't I'm getting rid of it. It's going like to the dump or like the donation like this is just a last ditch effort to make like $12 today. That is whatever Arch sales should be but there are people who are out here trying to make money off their actual garbage. And so every single year. I am like stabbing my knee with my fucking finger because I am like making a point here. Every year you're selling the same shit because nobody wants to buy your fucking lamp that doesn't work. But like somebody could fix it. Like if they knew how to fix lamps. Nobody wants that for $60. Okay, they don't care. They don't care about your fucking lamp or TVs. How about TVs at a garage sale? That's a works on it like it with a piece of tape works. I'm It doesn't work at that means it doesn't work or like refrigerator or like a small freezer or something with like a shit ton of like Hammer dents in it. You're like what the fuck it's like Rusty and they're like $30 works like it doesn't work. That's the thing. It literally doesn't work. It can't it can't work and I'm cynical about this because I bought a sno-cone maker at a garage sale for $5 one time and let me tell you I don't Don't know if I was just not strong enough to crush the ice with my like 10 year old hands, but that shit didn't work. That should did not work and that really pissed me off. Also, the fact that the woman at the garage sale told me the flavors are inside the box and I got it home and there were no flavors in the fucking box. So I was like up in there putting chocolate Hershey's syrup and like fucking Aunt Jemima is maple syrup on Ice. That's sad and Ice that was not crushed well, Looks like it was just basically a glass of ice that I was like putting maple syrup on and I was convincing myself that I Really Got A Deal ridiculous. But grad' shelling became a part of my life at a young age and then it cascaded into later in life every summer. We would go with my mom's friend Nancy who is amazing. That is who my mother was with when she bought the infamous four pairs of underwear. She sending me that let me tell you they are American Eagle beak until like a chubby person used to wear them because they have that lip in the elastic where it's like folded over a little like a taco and now it's like permanently Fold it over. I know what that looks like because I have seen underwear like that in my own collection where they have like a little permanent fold from just like where you're sitting in the in the elastic fold over. So that'll be cute to try to conform to my body and also they're like a little faded, but you know what? Listen, I believe in a washing machine. I believe in like I'm somebody who if you shit your pants. I don't believe in throwing away the clothes. I don't believe like if you shit your pants unless they're like white because like nobody's trying that like who's there all day trying to get the stain out, but then that's like gross maybe to think about Like because it's white you see the stain but if they were like a black pair of underwear and you shit your pants you would have liked. You'd have the shit stay in there. You just can't see the shitstain but maybe under like the right light you would see like an outline of like where where it happened. It's terrible. Okay garage sale without time in my out 21. All right wrapping it up. So used to go every Thursday Grudge feeling is amazing. He got to go for a deal people who try to rip you off get the fuck just go away. Get out of there also kids shit. It really makes me think about like kids shit. Like if God forbid I ever have children someday. I know better than to like by my like 18 month old some bullshit like little car like that they can sit on and then hit like squeaky buttons and stuff because that shit then just sits there and also like there are so many other things that in 18 month old would love like an iPad and they're going to love an iPad for years. They would like you give a six-month-old an iPad and they will use an iPad till they're like eight until they want a phone. Like an iPad saving you money as fucked up as it as it is to give kids like iPads and shit like that. Give it to him and they won't need any other toys. They will not need anything to bounce around in to make like make fake phone calls and shit like that. They can like watch YouTube and they can be better for it. Wow, good advice. Okay, also do I even want to get into this? I mean, whatever but just speaking on. I had something else to say about garage sales and that's like the topic but episode 2. We're already doing the thing where we're not we're not even talking about the topic anymore. But here's the thing about shitting your pants. I've realized in my days that like there are people who look like they farted and they're people who don't if this makes sense like this is a total change of subject, but I was just thinking about this, you know, because I was listening to a podcast where a girl was bitching about not bitching what she was talking about her like she was with this new guy and like she was still in that six-month period where you can't fart in front of them and you she accidentally did on this like At this restaurant like outside and she was like sitting on like a plastic white picnic table and she look farted and she was like, you know, she's like short and she's like cute and she's like a hundred pounds. And so she's like the beauty of it was nobody thought it was me like nobody thought that that like big fart came out of me and I was a really like made me think like wait a minute. I've been wronged. I've really been wronged like you we've all heard about like pretty privileged. That is something that I don't think people talk about about pretty privileged is that if you're pretty and you're like cute and you've got good style and a nice body and you like fart and you and it's like silent or something and you're in like a group of six. Nobody is pointing the finger at you. Nobody's pointing the finger at look too pretty girl to be like, oh my God you just fucking You're nasty nobody's doing that. But let me tell you who they are doing that too. They're doing that to me. And like I'm openly a person who will do it and I will like own it. But I own it. I always own it unless I do this hilarious thing where I either say it wasn't me and then instantly say it was or I say, it doesn't stink but like if I'm in like a car or something even if I'm with people, I don't know. This is the fucked-up part. This is fucked up because this has happened to me where I have not been the one who dealt the motherfucker in the car or on a bus or something. This actually happened. This fully happened to me in like 7th or 8th grade on a basketball and I was like, I sat in the front behind the bus driver. This is sad. I don't think I've ever told anybody this. I was blamed for like a really smelly fart. Okay, and we were on the bus like back from a fucking away game for basketball or some shit now mind you I was not like if you can just tell from my voice. I was not an active like member of the team. Okay, I would like do my 30 seconds. I would go down go back go down go back and then when at once I got to the point where when I was going down they were coming back then Coach took me out of the game. It was like listen. You killed that. I'm like, thank you. And then I like proceeded to eat all the concessions and like to Gatorades on the bench. So I wasn't fuxing with like I wasn't like, you know active and like getting all my fucking stomach all riled up like that. Okay, I wasn't doing that. I was being very chill and very cool and calm about the situation. So I wasn't like gassy like that. Anyway somebody like really Really laid an egg on the bus and people were like Travis Travis. Oh, I was like done. I was so done. I was like it was so not me it was so not me and this has happened in my life among friends among Strangers Like if there's a smell people will look to me like you stink like you look like maybe you stink you farted. It's really ooh shit, and I hate it and I think you next time you smell a stinky smell and you like look around the room and you're like who did this and you look at like the like person who's like maybe a little less fortunate looking or like their little out of shape or like maybe they have like a neck hair that they don't even know about maybe look Inward and be like, is this am I giving like pretty privileged to These other people in this car because everyone can lay one out. Everyone can hatch an egg. Okay, everyone has the opportunity and everyone has done it and fuck you. Okay, thank you. Garage sales garage saling love it. Okay. Well, like I said, thank you for listening. This is fucking great that I talked about garage saling and farting for 28 minutes killer. Nothing is getting edited. Thank you. Players players that is and gentlemen players plus own just sit down and listen to my song about a man who got himself in Davao City Jabo then weekend. The once was a man around 10 a.m. Hoof. It chased Fireball with Patron. He was at a country music festival and he met two Canadian girls. Something happened between them that day. Maybe he was drunk. Maybe he didn't know otherwise, but he followed these two girls to their tent. Well, it was really to his demise we were going through the campsites and he thought oh God the son Are we almost to your tent and they said yes, this is the one so they settled on in and for some reason this man took a chance with these two he started sucking on their titties and flicking their being Oh my it was quite a choice for the man and these two reciprocated in other ways. I'm not going to get into detail, but you know, it got really sweaty because a two-person tent only has enough room for so much fun. And then they ended up passing out and he woke up with a kick. It was a swift kick to the side of his ribs and then one to his neck. Nighttime by now and there were security guards. They said get out get out to this tent and he got out of the tent in quite a day's worth the headache and just scratch these men next to the tent said yeah, that's what you get as she get for fucking in our tent G4 fucking girls in our tent. Yeah, get the fuck out of here go to we Fest jail. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you and so he was so confused the The security guard said this is not your tent I said and not by me. I mean he said, oh I was invited here. I was invited here by these two women and the security guard said it's not there change either. Oh next thing, you know the poor man had zip ties around his wrists and he was headed off alone with the security guards. Go 50 feet, maybe 100. I don't know but they cut the zip ties off and said something like stay out of trouble. We don't want to see you again. So we had it on back to his friends. He went into a porta potty. Madhu a bunch of Snapchat stories by the time he got back to his friends. They were worried sick about him. He told them all about his jail, but here he was making his most crucial mistake honest. somehow I've received gotten back the German accent I've started with but Ernst his mistake was his friend was setting him up with a very cute young man named Cory, and he thought Cory was straight Cory was very curious. And now after learning that the man had put fingers inside of these two Canadian hussies. Now Cory was not convinced. This man was a gay. They were convinced. He was straight and nothing ever happened between him and Cory except for one Snapchat. Maybe one week later. He got to see Cory's ass and that's it. And it's a story he's told for so long and you'll tell it I'm do you do here? Okay, so I want to tell you about this porn tape that circulated through our house for like an actual decade where different members of the family would have access to this VHS tape that had like five different porns on it and three I actively remember one was. I like a girl who she was like probably mid 20s, and she was like getting interviewed and she was like she was like in like a sexy like robe or something hot and she like had like a nipple out or whatever like while she was talking. She was like laughing and she was extra free spirit and she was really nice and she wasn't really like doing porn necessarily. She was just kind of being an interviewed as a porn star but then like towards the end of it. She started like teaching People how she would like masturbate and stuff like that second week in a row that this long story short has included masturbation, but she was like showing you and stuff and I the first time I saw this tape, I was probably seven or eight years old and I watched it with my brother. There was another video in the on this VHS. It's probably like a six-hour VHS tape. And it had a woman getting gangbanged in a like a mechanic shop. She like just need her car fixed or something and then they were like well, how how is your oil and she's like, well, I could use like a Liu bang or whatever and then they were like, okay. Well listen, let me just get a couple guys in here and we'll just you know, fuck your brains out. So then they did and she was chubby which I liked. I love the representation even as a young child and then there was a third one. A gay porn crazy so I don't know how this all got to our house. But the tape was called Cherry XXX and that's like what it said on it and it was like Infamous in this family it because nobody talked about it when they didn't have it or even when they had like nobody talked about this tape until like I was in college and I was like, how about that? At motherfucking tape that was all up in this house like because the thing is is it was crazy because like me and my brother would have it. Okay, and we'd like watch it and then he would like jerk off in his bed. And then I would like listen to Jessica Simpson CDs while I watched it and Because we shared a room until he was in his until he was 20 and I was 15 which I think is you know masochistic, but then like you would have it in the VHS like in our room and the next thing you know, it wouldn't be there or like we'd put it in like a one of our dresser drawers or something and then it wouldn't be there and then you'd be like, oh shit like mom or dad like found the tape like oh God, we're gonna get in so much trouble except for nobody said anything. Nobody said literally anything and then you know, like a few months would go by and long story short people. We would find this tape like in like dad's drawer like mom's office or like all this stuff and everybody got like a turn for like 10 years and you could have the tape for like up to like six months. I would say without like losing it if you were like really sneaky about hiding it, but then like they'd be like the day we're cleaning. You know the kids bedroom and we're like doing this whole thing and then like somehow in the muscle of fuss you like are like where the fuck's the tape where the fuck's of tape because I'm having friends over I just told them about like I told my friends like oh my God, you guys have to see this video. It's like literally it's so late. Like we're not going to sleep because well, you're not that you're definitely not going to sleep because I'm going to scar you with seeing some very graphic shit that now I've watched the movie like 30 times at this point I've got I've got the moans memorized but you're going to love this and like when you see like all the guys coming on all the other guys like you're going to be like I didn't even know this was an option and and you're going to love it because I loved it. So I just assumed everybody else would love it. They didn't love it. Just I mean, I'm putting that out there. There was a lot of friends I had over who really did not like the the male on male. V which was literally my favorite of the time so I was like, this is just so weird and he makes sense now obviously, but I did love I looking back. I really appreciate the diversity of the porn tape. Like I look at my parents and I'm like wow. Wow, like you got this, you know, you got the young pretty girl that everyone expected. Then you got like the chubby like middle mid-40s female gang bang and then you have you have the gay porn. I wish I could remember like what the other two were but very very good and the gay porn was it was like military was very like military, which my dad was in the Army. So I would like loved I loved a call back. I love like a relatable film. But it was just really nice. It was really nice. And I remember oh my god when you'd catch somebody else with it because I think me and my brother only watched it together like a couple of times then it became like a thing where it was like either. I had it her he had it over like the next however many years and because it was like used as leverage of like I'll tell that you have it. I'll tell that you have it so you couldn't you couldn't tell who had it, but remember one day so sick so fucking disgusting. I like Cup like it was just me and my brother home. I like woke up. And on the big screen TV. We'd like a big screen TV. That was not like a it was like a but TV but it was like huge and my God, where is that thing? You know what? It's probably at a garage sale right now, and it probably has a piece of tape on it says Works to be honest, but Anyway, we weren't supposed to even play movies on this TV because this TV was like I don't know what the story was at this TV, but it had like a it was like a pre plasma type thing. Like if I had like a plasma element to it, you know, like plasma screen and so like it wasn't supposed to have like any kind of like processing besides TV, and this could have been like absolute bullshit that my parents said so that we couldn't watch movies on it and we couldn't play video games on it because it was like the MTV so they probably just fed us this bullshit that it was like yeah, you'll like mess up the screen if you play with this, but actually looking back we had to like calibrate the screen or like configure it like quite a bit later on in the years and we totally snuck putting video games and shit on it. So maybe that was true. But I remember on the big screen. I like go out, you know to go eat breakfast or something and it was like you don't to clock in the afternoon because I love to sleep in and my brother was Was like literally on the floor butt-ass naked in our living room. Just given it he'll just just really really getting in there and I was like, oh my God, but it was amazing because he I was like, I know I know you have to tape and I'm going to tell obviously because I'm a little brother and I'm going to tell And if I remember correctly, he had to hit the lotion my feet. And I think I like let him get away with it after you lotion my feet but I would love to know where that video ended up now in somebody's hands because we don't even have a VHS player anymore, but it's so sad because it was so good and then and then when I brought it up years later. it was like Oh, I don't know about that. Oh, I don't know. I think I think I got it as a gag gift. Oh, yeah. I think I think maybe we watched it one time. We just laughed we didn't even we even use it even use the tape. I'm like hmm. Same thing with this sick as fuck which I just saw recently. Oh my God, I'm going to get into this. This is too much for this show. But I'll get into it for you guys, basically. There's like a sex toy thing happening and on this side of so might the way my parents bed was it was a California king with mirrors on the top. It had like banisters and it was like so like you get in the bed and you could you could look at yourself in the mirror and it was like a very sexy bad, but it used to be it's like the frame was meant for a waterbed so underneath there were all these drawers just underneath the bed like you. just like you know and one day this Roar we hit the jackpot and by we I mean me and I saw my first Playboy and it was with China the wrestler stunning looked amazing and there was a multiple Playboy's and there was a couple play girls and there was like this dildo that was like this flash color dildo that I was like, What is des I mean, I might be like 10 years old. Oh my God also side note. Very young age in my parents bed one time I was caught. I don't know what I was doing. This is like embarrassing but I was caught like I had Barbies that I played with obviously and I like for some reason was just like in my underwear and I was like, I'm going to tie them up in my underwear. And so I just I just like took off my underwear and just like kind of like how you'd put a hair tie your hair and you just kind of fold it over and you just keep folding. Over until the state I did not sleep for Barbies and they were all like naked and I was like making them like fuck and stuff and then my dad walked in the room like and I was on their bed like on their bed spread looking back. I'm like, this is why I cannot have children because I don't know if I could have a relationship with my child after when they're like seven there like bare butt ass naked on my comforter like with their Barbies tied up like like making moaning noises like they're fucking mic. That's dark. That's really sick. So I don't know why I did that but I was like into it and I also I was like and like putting the Barbies like hair like very gently over like my soft flaccid penis. It just felt good. And anyway, so China was the wrestler in Playboy. I was like obsessed lived for it. Then there was this dildo and I like didn't see this dildo for like years and years and years. I'm telling you. I maybe saw when I was like 10 to 12 are area. Okay, never saw it again. Like I don't know. I don't know there was like my fingerprints were on the like I don't know what it was but I never start again until just like literally a year ago. Okay, I'm 24 a year ago. I was like in my parents in my mom's bathroom. Okay, and just like where she keeps like extra shampoos and stuff that she's like coupon for over the years. Amongst it was wrapped in like what do you call that plastic wrap? Like Saran Wrap like just wrapped up the fuck in Saran Wrap was this goddamn dildo from years before? I'm like, what are we doing with this and classic tale? So I said my mother why is there a witch this is another thing like you can't have kids because do you really want to just off the cuff be presented with these kind of insane questions that you The lie about like so I was like, why is there amongst the bulk shampoo a dildo with plastic wrap around it. I was like, I remember this dildo from being in the cupboard under your fucking bed. And she was like, oh, I don't know. We got that as a gag gift like long time ago. I'm like how many fucked-up friends do you have that are getting you these? All these sexual fucked up things as gag gifts. Also just thinking about it the Cherry X XS X tape like giving somebody a porn video as a gag gift. That's a nice lap, but getting somebody a porn video that is like copied over and like recorded from like Playboy TV and like multiples other things and like taken from like another porn and like over overridden and stuff like that. Like it was like definitely an Perfect recording and it was not like a straight-up movie. It was like definitely like piece together type of shit. So I like the fact that anybody would put the time together to do a gate like that is not a gag gift to put together something that is like a six hour long that is insane as insane but a dildo is a very popular gag gift. So I'll let her go with it all so I know the woman loves a bullet so I just recently told somebody this would time ma'am. This is lovely. Oh my God, this is gonna be a long one. But this the story is going to be short. But basically, you know what? I'm saving it. I'm going to save it. I'm going to I teased you with I know that my mom likes a bullet. And I'm leaving you with that. So thank you for listening. This was super fun and I'll see you next Sunday.

Trevor Lewis is on the lookout for every known kink to exist, and these aren’t the kinds of kinks you are probably thinking. Niche topics for a collective audience and improvisational songs about embarrassing or traumatic times set to a broadway or dramatic tone, as well as a ‘long story short’ that is never as short as you’d hope.

We are going to be talking about Ruby Volume 7 episode 6 a night off, but it's not as fun as it sounds. Yeah, we've got a lot of feelings to to sort through this week. I'm your host Meghan Salinas and with me as always is a group of wonderful fantastic host. With me in the room is the fantastic Katie Cullen. Hi all my buddies calling in from Los Angeles is the lovely Stacy shuttleworth. Hello. Hello and calling in from all the way across the country is the wonderful Mark bead Annika, it's me it is you feel like that's all I got. I think we all could use a night off. So this this episode was going to supposed to be very cathartic and then we all went. Nope. How like life nobody. It's a night off you start in with it's me and you give me Immediate Five Nights at Freddy's flashbacks. So thanks, but no thanks. I'm going to start this discussion off by yelling and screaming. How about how I demand a recount God. So yeah, this is gonna be a fun one to talk about a little housekeeping at this at the top of the show. I want to go ahead and apologize to everybody in advance. My voice is still a little bit on the outs. So I have myself a Hot toddy with me mostly for my throat, but also a little bit for the booze given what we're talking about tonight and we talked about this off mic a little bit. But normally we like to keep political discussions kind of we kind of like to keep real world politics out of our show unless it directly relates to the discussion at hand and given the overt parallels between this episode. Oh and real-world events. We are going to be talking about real world politics. And if that bothers you I'm not going to say that maybe this isn't the episode for you. I'm actually going to do the opposite. I would like to invite you to sit down and please listen to us because if you were one of the people that was really happy about the 2016 election, I would invite you to be to I would invite you. Keep an open mind and to listen and to ask yourself. Look at you know the state of the world today because of the day of this recording is the same day that our House of Representatives issued two articles of impeachment to our president and I want you to ask yourself. If this is everything you ever hoped it would be and if it is why is that and if it isn't why is that so please keep an open mind? I know everybody likes to stay in their Echo Chambers, everybody's guilty of that. But please keep an open mind. And yeah, we were going to talk about it and it's not fun to have to talk about those things, but it's unavoidable and we have a lot of feelings about it. And so we're going to start go ahead and going ahead and working through that. So, you know, that's not as much fun typically as we know but there is going to be fun stuff in this episode. We promise. There I have a lot to talk about when once we get to our over to our shipping shelf and I have a little surprise for all of you when it comes to our shipping shelf. Not really a fun bit. Anyway, so let's go ahead and get the ball rolling on this one. How did we all feel in the wake of this episode for me personally. It was very very very reminiscent of the end of volume 3 in multiple ways. And I feel like it's very Cinelli reminiscent of the end of volume 3 and the feelings that are evoked from the end of that volume. So how do we feel about this episode? Let's go ahead and start with mr. Donaga man. There was some I mean with Ruby we talk about ruby in a particular tense various times when we're like ah, it's Ruby. So we expect this sort of a thing and as certain events were happening in the story. I suppose you could say a certain positive events at the story. There is just an overarching sense of okay, but when is it all going to pop off and with in the wake of watching this episode like Saturday was a very very busy day for me and and I watched this episode in between to sort of not high pressure situations, but a lot of high high aware situations where I had to be very present and so Sort of rekindling how I was feeling at the time just pressure. This was one of the most tense episodes because for those of us who lived this this most previous election and and hearing all the like you've got it in the bag or all of the the dialogue of this and that is just if why this this is this going to truly be a fantasy series Or is this going to be a lens looking at the modern world and as it was getting closer and closer to the end and jocks percentages, we're getting closer and closer as stuff just kept unfolding. It was just for me. It was a thought of how bad is this going to get I 100% concur with that sentiment of like, okay. This is this is where things start to happen how yeah, how you Are we at the point where its darkest just before the dawn? Have we gotten to the darkest part yet? And the answer is probably not. No. Oh chance Stacy. How did you feel this? This is a did so many things so skilfully from the sense of sinking that was so disproportionate to what was happening with like the celebration party. Just watching that screen in the background really inspired like just an absolute sense of foreboding and yes, I do feel like it was way deeper personally because we I've been through that. But just so beautifully played off of what was happening in the foreground and the background and I would I would almost call this episode a beautiful bait and switch except. More or less knew what was coming. I'm dying. Hey there guy. Nothing, like getting 2016 episode flashbacks two weeks in a row, but here we are like I am so mad at this episode. I'm so mad at this episode for being like here's this thing that you've been waiting for for forever and sticking it in the middle of an episode that is ridiculously anxiety-inducing to the point where it's like no I cannot turn my brain off enough to enjoy this because I know what's coming because I Lived what's coming because I'm still not over what I know is coming like it is. Yeah. This was a difficult one to watch. It really really was because again, we lived through this and we specifically establish that hey this hacker character is on the side of the CEO who doesn't have to morals to rub together and owns a very large company and once a political seat for his own gain like you Couldn't be more obvious. If you tried the only things that are in Congress are the fucking color schemes of the CEOs. I didn't I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of yelling watching this one, especially with the ever-changing vote percentages everywhere. So every time the episode tried to throw me a bone, I stared at it and just went I know it's coming. I know what's coming. It's going to be bad just do it already and then it was bad and I'd like to say that I felt better once I knew that it was coming, but no, no, it felt exactly the same. You might I can't wait to see Jean an Oscar and Weiss walking out of the movies to the world being in hell because on that night in 2016. We were in a show on another Network and we started the show when things were great and at the end of the show, when we checked our phones things were solidly in hell and continued to spiral for the rest of the night. So I've been at the I'm going to the movies. I don't want to think about it crew and I just I don't know how well I'm going to handle these next few episodes while we're dealing with the aftermath of this. I honestly don't know having some trouble. It hit very close to home. Yeah. Yeah, it had very close to home. I had words for this and now they've escaped me and I'm sorry no, no. No, I sincerely mean that because like this was an excellent episode. This was a master class in suspense building and it that the lighter moments because this is a product that has come out in our cultural Zeitgeist. The audience is expected to know exactly what's about to go down because as we've all said we lived it and so I feel like that dramatic irony is embedded into this episode. And so you really do feel That suspense and Dread building and building and building and to this episode's credit. It still is executed in a way that was exceedingly surprising because I definitely did not see things going down at that Victory party the way they did so I definitely commend this episode but he does hit very close to home because for me personally the election of 2016 November 8 the I believe it was Teen was one of the most it wasn't the worst like the worst day of my life because nobody died or anything like that, but it is distinctly In My Memory one of the most memorably bad days I've ever had in my life and like because of a lot of personal stuff that was going on in addition to the election. So it is a day that is forever seared into my brain and I think it is for a lot. of people as well, so watching this episode and kind of having all of those feelings re evoked is something that you know, it's it is provocative it and it's meant to be so but what I really like about ruby in particular and just about Rooster Teeth shows in general is there's no such thing necessarily as a political art and and something that research has been excellent about especially in the in the wake of 2016 and we talked about this a lot during our Jen lockdown show is overwhelming optimism in the face of overwhelming odds and tragedy and despair. Yeah, and it's so funny that this episode hits so close to home and is so emotionally devastating because if you Kind of lean back again on the theme of the opening theme of this season. It's all about dreaming for a better world and believing in love and I think that's remarkable in the face of what we're about of what's about to go down in the narrative. So okay enough punted enough pontificating for me. Let's go ahead and get into the nitty-gritty of this episode and structurally speaking. We might be a little all over the place again. Please forgive. Of us but let's go ahead and go with it. So we start off in the danger room. Yay danger room. It's so fun getting training stuff and we get some fun. We get some fun moments between characters that it's a lot of fun seeing them bounce off of each other. What was your favorite Danger Room moment. Let's go ahead and start with Stacy. I really liked Oscar taking the role of like moderator and trainer. And kind of so cute adorable just slipping into that kind of analysis type role because we know he's training hard to but he did he's also kind of playing up these other strength. So I appreciated seeing him like with his commentary as everyone whizzed around him Mark. How about you? Um, I think just the effort in general like speaking of how Ironwood is looking toward everybody really working their asses off. There wasn't anything particularly that that stuck out to me other than I guess the mini night that that why summoned I thought that was a I think she's going to use size to her Advantage. It doesn't always have to be the biggest and the baddest but I think ultimately it's going to be being smarter like on the whole is out thinking the opponent the night stood out to me too because that was incredibly clever like I think that was also my Apart. Yeah, I think Weiss gets we're giving everybody grades in the danger room. I think Weiss definitely gets a plus and potentially even MVP of this little training moment. But yeah to touch on what Stacy was saying about Oscar, you know, he it's such a fun moment to see him evaluating and being analytical about it, especially because he still hasn't activated his semblance and it's funny because for a long time we were were speculating about what Jean's semblance would be and now that John's unlocked his semblances and is excelling now our attention kind of shifts back to Oscar and be like, okay. What's the baby's symbol is going to be your next kid. So given what we know about Oscar. Does anybody have any predictions about what his semblance could be and will we see it before by the time the season wraps up? Let's go ahead and start with Katie. For some reason. My brain has put Oscar and baby Yoda from the Mandalorian in the same place here. So Oscar is a force user. I'm calling it now adorable must be protected green, you know. Stacy it's so obvious. Now. How can I compare? Mr. Donaga? I'm just gonna be bad for the fences and say polarity. Oh, I imagine the thing that I see more than his actual semblance is that Jean is going to help him sort of activate it similarly to well for Purpura, it was Aura but I think Jean is going to in turn help Oscar with the next level of his training. I really like that theory all the way around. We got to get the positivity in somewhere this episode. We find it where we can and yeah, I I don't necessarily gosh semblances are so interesting. I very much feel like it's going to be something along the lines of yeah being able to physically alter the world around him and whether that's with telekinetic abilities, it's in my head. Now. I just it's gonna be telekinetic abilities other potential things the ability to shut down other people semblances. Mmm. Ooh, that's a cut through that would be interesting. Yeah to just kind of it's like having in superhero then superhero media you occasionally have someone whose power is essentially anti-power anyone around them is essentially becomes normal. Like that's what I want to see. I want to see Oscar with a power nuke to be able to just shut off people semblances at will it'd be like Anti-Venom. I'm just evening out the playing field. Like I would love to see that be his thing antivenom in in Spider-Man essentially can if you spend enough time around him if Peter spends enough time around him nullifies all of his spider abilities, that would be really cool. Especially if within that same person is an unending well of magic like that's a little not fair to have somebody to be able to turn off your abilities and Just hit you with a wall of magic. That's a little Opie and I kind of love it the baby deserves the best but Oscar have this delay season 8 for balancing issues. I'm sure they'll patch that at some point. Mmm. Nice Ruby pun. Okay, guys, I'm gonna need you all to stop it with the jokes. Stop making you like that one. That was all you you needed. You guys need to lock it up and I'm looking specifically over at you. Mr. Tanaka. I'm looking in the direction of Florida. I'm going to need you to lock it up with these Goofs. So it's Florida that way damn it. None of you will be happy until I'm dead Jesus, but I'll have died. The smile so it'll be fine. So let's let's go ahead and talk about yeah, Ironwood. He seems to be kind of frustrated either way with the results of the election. But as as Yang points out better Robin than Jacques and yeah 100% there's hands-down mantle Atlas. There's only one Clear Choice here. The other one's a monster. Why would you pick anything? an else hashtag capitalism Hmm and also hashtag hack the vote Ironwood recognizes that no matter what it's going to be a new day in the morning. So he wants all of our boys and girls to go and take the night off and enjoy themselves. And so we get everybody sir. We get to split the party Blake and yang decide to go off to a dance club with Team funky Ruby noren ran decide to head to Robin's Victory party. T go hang out with Penny and Marrow all that fun stuff and Oscar and Oscar's Jean and Weiss decide to go to the movies. Now. Which group would you go with Katie movies? Also I have to say that the delivery. Hey, we're going to go to the movies anyway yet. Okay like that that that made me very happy Stacy that was precious and I would also have gone to the movies. Well, at least in the dark theater nothing for a while until a grim burst through the screen. Wow, this three-piece looking really good. Damn baby toe tippy toes. So Mark, I guess you would also go to the movies. Like I guess it would also depend on what club they were going to like what type of a club they're going to but my initial Instinct was yeah the movies and and to sort of follow up on the discussion we had last week about weisen Jean. I think John's reaction to Weiss. Is going with them is an indicator of where his mind is on the subject of Weiss and romantic feelings Mark Mark. Are are you chopping over towards the shipping? So I'm actually I'm standing vehement lie in conspiracy corner, and then we were wrong. I think he was agreeing with my point last week that we haven't really seen any romantic development between the two I chaired that belief less. Due to lack of romance. All right. All right, we'll get to it we'll get to it. But yeah, I definitely go to the movies to why I like going out to dance clubs. But yeah, it would usually not the ones where you wear as Yang indicates. You can't hear other people around you which is a selling point for her when it comes to team funky. Definitely a detractor for me. I wouldn't that is not the type of Club. I enjoy but yeah, so I did want to point out that there's been a lot of kind of theory talk Mark. If you don't mind. I'm going to scoot on over to conspiracy Corner as well. There's been a lot of theory talk about Nora this volume and particularly in relation to her back story because back story wise we know that she ended up in rennes Hometown, but It's we don't know anything about her prior to that. We know that the winter Maiden is you know, her name is Fria. I believe is that that's correct, which is a direct reference to Norse mythology like Nora because Nora is our Thor basically so there have been a lot of people who have been kind of speculating that Nora is actually from mantle and potentially has still has family here. There have been a few theories that maybe she's related to free that maybe she was originally from mantle before she became an orphan. I don't know. What do you do you guys happen to think that Nora might be from mantle and that's one of the reasons why she's being so supportive of Robin and Robbins kind of mission statement of wanting to do. Best for mantle let's go ahead and start with Katie. I'm sorry. I was looking at the etymology of Fria to see if that stood up and I missed the question. Oh, just do you think there's any weight to that theory? The theory that she yeah, maybe I don't again we have virtually nothing about her. So there's wait to almost any Theory. Stacy what about you? I don't think it necessarily has to be mantel but I think that that kind of society that kind of Life Style like that that City setting is familiar and very deeply personal to her. I think the plights of the people of mantle strike a deep personal coat cord whether or not it was mantle she was from or a place that was similar. Yeah, the the struggle of The Haves versus the have-nots. Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. Mark yeah, I agree with Stacey on this one. It seems a little bit more of an indirect and there's no like direct tie between Freya and Thor they're just both people in Norse mythology and gods they're both members of the pantheon, but in terms of direct relation, as far as I can recall the really there isn't one, but I there's a lot that I've been saying it and you can all attest to this. I've been saying it for seasons is that Nora has it we haven't seen Nora talk about what happened and we finally get a little bit tonight, but it wasn't it was a good start and I think the at the very least the rest of the season is going to help sort of establish where nor is mine space is I think that's a really good point because she is I'm pretty vocal about how she feels about you know, supporting Robin and about whether or not there's a possibility that Salem can be defeated. There's this really interesting beat where you know, Nora is the one that points out. Maybe Oz asked the wrong question, you know. Oz was the one that was told that he couldn't destroy Salem. Maybe somebody else could could there's there's a very specific beat where Nora delivers that line while looking at Ruby and it's it's so fascinating seeing Nora's like kind of intuition looking at Ruby when Ruby doesn't necessarily see that within herself or if she does she understands kind of like the the weight of that responsibility because throughout a good chunk up until they start hanging out with Penny. Ruby's pretty crestfallen the entire time they're hanging out first with this, you know the dilemma with Robin and the Dilemma with what to divulge to Ironwood. And yeah and then immediately going into the party and having the couple you're with starting to fight and and you know, just kind of having to deal with all of that before shit hits the fan. So it's it's hard to see. Character who's filled with so much light and so much goodness be so downtrodden because of the overall, you know, it's it's very reminiscent of when the apathy were running around last volume, but I do since I since I mentioned the couple starting to fight we have Mark, I hope you don't mind but we are going to move on over to the shipping shelf. Well, so here's the thing is this is this is sort of a thing that I've been talking about their relationship. It has been a piece of written material for since the beginning of the of the Season at the season of the show. So this isn't necessarily shipping to me. This is stuff that's happening as a part of the show. It's Cannon ship. It's a specific subset, but yes, it is indeed shipping. Yeah, I can in shipping and okay. So what I wanted to say about the shipping shelf since it was getting a little crowded all of us sitting on to that shelf. I hope you guys don't mind but I did a little redecorating the shipping shelf is now a loft. Whoo. Right now there's wait for everyone. Wait. Is it the love Loft crap now if I was gonna say not doesn't work. There's no alliteration upgraded. I got more room down here in the bar. I mean conspiracy Corner. Oh six of one half a dozen of the other. Let's be real. So who would like to join me on the love Loft? I've been here the whole time. Yeah, I think I live up here now. Sorry guys. So what that I just imagine like super like what was it the whole make extreme a whole make home remodel whatever the shows are and it's like move that bus and you like Stacy was standing next to you as you revealing it. But as you reveal it, she's already like inside before we haven't named Stacy just teleports and sticks her head out the window. Hello. I've picked this room like what you've done with the place. I live here. There's more seating and more room for ships. We've got lots of fancy chairs and bean bag chairs. Oh, yes. All right, so to get back to it and yeah, I yeah so Mark, I apologize. I hope you don't mind that I redecorated the whole room. Yay. Not the whole damn room. Well, I left most of your corner untouched. I did I did steal a couple bottles of booze. It's all in boxes. I thought we just like literally added another level to this space. That's what a loft is indeed. Conspiracy corner is now the conspiracy Cove because it's got more than one corner and the love loft is a full thing unto itself. You just have to go upstairs. Let love Lift You Higher by the time we're done with this volume of Ruby. We're going to have a clue style Mansion beautiful. I kind of want a Knives Out style mansion with all the lake hidden staircases and shit. We will have a Knives Out style mansion. Anyway, so yes, let's talk about some Cannon shipping because kind of what becomes a little bit of a point of contention is Nora and ren discussing Blake and yang and the status of their relationship and it's one of those couple fights where they're talking about a different set of people but they're obviously not talking about those people. They're talking about themselves and poor Ruby when you're in that situation, Should have like oh this that I'm with two people and I'm caught in the middle of an argument time for me to bail by we've all been I think in that situation before but here yeah, this is this is the moment where not only is the narrative basically making it explicit that Blake and yang have been through so much together that it's probably more and again, this is me leaning in and going like okay we're getting there. Make it Canon by the end of the volume pretty pretty please and that we seem to be heading in that direction. But Ren and Nora, you know, we've been ever since volume for when they Revisited their past and their on that Helicarrier with you know, and they ended up holding hands as they're making their way to Haven Academy. We haven't really circled back on their relationships since then and that was such a pivotal. Moment and we've had a lot of discussions with the talent as well talking about how like this is it's clearly there. It doesn't necessarily need to be spoken but there's been a lot going on in the narrative to make Nora potentially a little insecure. Maybe it is just seeing the state of mantle and you know the new normal that they're getting accustomed to working with the Aesop's and everything like that. Nora needs to hear it. It and wrens Never Been Good With Words, and that's when we get the moment where she's like, okay, I'm done talking then and they kiss and it's amazing and it's wonderful. And I know that I know that it's ultimately that the good part doesn't last all that long because it's a precedes everything going to hell but this was one nice moment before the world caught on fire. So what did we all? Think of this since Cannon shipping is the only shipping you really like to discuss. Let's go ahead and start with you mark, so I'm going to admit and I have admitted before my wife and I have been talking about this episode previously, but I have been ran in this situation. I'm not saying that he did the right thing at all, but I'm I'm happy that they got this expression out there, but I do have the sense of what Ren is To do next because he's been talking about sort of Duty. He's been talking about staying Vigilant like not wanting to be out and wanting to be working and all of this stuff and I have a feeling that moving forward or at least in the very near future Ren's going to blame Nora for taking his attention off of the scene where he could have saved more people and ultimately at the end of it he'll he'll either He'll turn inward and be like no it wasn't you. Like there's a lot of other things going on. Eventually. He'll think better of it. But I think in the short term just as soon as they came together quote unquote confirmed in Facebook official. They're going to be a part and it will be the first time that we've seen it ever in the show. So I think that Nora is going to go through a pretty big change. JH + r/n is going to stay the same most of the time until he he decides what he has to do and I hope I will say that I hope that he comes out of it a better person and a little bit more acknowledging of nor has feelings and reciprocates a little bit more. See this is why we don't let Mark in the love Loft he ruins things. What's up? What's ruining? I do think you have I do think Have a really good point honestly, especially since in the lead-up to that kiss. We had such good dialogue and we had a really good look at what their opposing viewpoints were Nora getting really tired of waiting and ren trying to find a time when life isn't completely cuckoo bananas in order to actually talk about it. What Ren doesn't realize is that life is never not completely cuckoo bananas. And if you're going to do something you have to make the time to do it and so I appreciate that we do kind of Of get that insight into their viewpoint on this relationship and how it should be handled. And so yeah, it's a good theory. I'm God. I'm hoping that's not the case because that's heartbreaking on top of literally everything else, but it's a good solid theory in terms of me. I'm again. I'm so mad that this happened during this episode when I was in a constant anxiety state watching those percentages on the screen change. I couldn't enjoy It it was one of those. Oh, it happened. Well, we know we're fucked. Anyway, let's let's just get on with it. Let's just get on with it. We know we're fucked. Like I couldn't actually enjoy it and I'm really mad about that Stacy. I'm actually 100% with Mark on this my first thought towards the end of this episode concerning run and Nora was oh God now all red is thinking is we kissed and people died not that's it. That's the end men like hell of a kiss. It's men. I mean absolutely there will be a horriffic Fallout after this. I don't think we will we will see happy Remora for a while as sad as that makes me Mark when when you postulated that theory my jaw literally dropped and then Stacey when you agreed with him, I clutched my non-existent pearls. I'm sorry, but that man that is Everyone I bought two and she's still doing it and and and to be fair like we're not we're not trying to divide the divide the room here, but you've got to married people in long-term relationships on one half and you've got no I'm not trying to I'm not trying to stir anything up, but I'm just saying you trying to say, mr. Jonathan. Listen, I prefaced the whole thing by saying I've been read and I can feel feel my wife's daggers burrowing through the wall. So yeah Marcus this comes from I know exactly how he's feeling sort of a place. This isn't the type of real you thought you were going to get this episode. Was it let me just dial it back a little bit and be happy for a second because I was genuinely like thrilled. Yeah Samuel when this happened then I remembered where I was not it could only last so long we all remembered. We're not allowed to have a nice big. Yeah, yeah, honestly you guys are right and anybody who's been in any type of relationship can understand that sort of miscommunication or like that moment where things are really really good and then something that has nothing to do with you guys or your relationship happens like in the real world. And all of a sudden that really really good moment is gone. Like anybody who's been in a relationship knows how that feels. So this isn't it exclusively a married versus single thing. Yeah, but no you guys definitely have the just being in committed relationships at the moment. You guys definitely have a leg up on that particular front speaking of real life ruining things. Let's let's talk about the murders. Real quick before we get to that before we get to our next topic. I do want to take a moment to thank everybody who's been listening to our show.

You guys are the best. Thank you so so much. All right, let's get back to it before we get to the murdering. Before we get to the murder, we do spend a little bit of time with with Penny and with marrow and it's really it's a really nice moment before it becomes kind of uncomfortable for I don't know why everybody gets the night off except marrow, like, you know, why? Yeah, he definitely probably drew the Short Straw but I don't think there were straws. I think he just got assigned. Signed like well, you know almond Vine are off doing their thing and hair already ran out and clovers got that hot date with crows. So sorry, you're on duty. Did we ever find out if the if the the Aesop's had the night off to know? I don't think we did like it was probably just is assignment look as far as I'm concerned Clover has a hot date with Crowe and you will not disappear Smee of that. Why tonight though? Why? Not huh? Okay, as I kill Megan in the background. All right, we need to get down from the the lovers Loft real quick. I refuse okay. But yeah, we we have this interaction between the happy huntresses and the Aesop's and obviously from the previous episode. We know that things haven't necessarily been on the best terms between the two groups. But I don't know they're like it's funny because they're ultimately all working towards the same goal, but the ways they're going about it are vastly different and it's so interesting the the way that Robin is trying to appeal to marrow because one of the things she insist on is that she's trying to make things better for the faunus as well and as though she can kind of win him over that way and he's like, that's cool. The law still the law you're still going to do this All Above the book, right and Robin going. Yep. Everything I've done is super super legal and no one can prove. Otherwise, it's only illegal. If you get caught ultimately I feel like with what transpires later in the night. This is basic. It's going to basically lead to Robin kind of abandoning any any sort of pretense that she's a law-abiding citizen and is ultimately going to be like, hey, this might be against the law but it's what's right. It's what's just but I don't know. Maybe she's maybe she's more aware of the situation than we think I don't know. Do you guys think that Robin is ultimately just going to abandon Law and Order completely or do you think that because of this? Interaction and the way the night transpires that she actually is kind of more aware and is willing to talk. Let's go ahead and start with Stacy. Honestly, I do think that she is a little more savvy than kind of the mistrust that was really played up towards the end of this episode where you know, she doesn't know what's going on. We don't well we know what's going on, but to the general public it looks like she's been betrayed and and I don't really see her going like becoming a big batter or becoming an opposing Force. At least not for a lengthy period of time I do think that she'll kind of cotton on that something is happening and there's open communication everybody. It's really good for us. That's definitely Nora stance on things. Well, Katie, what do you think? I think that Robin is definitely Savvy enough to know with her stint with her standing as a public figure if she goes Rogue things will get very bad very fast because other people are going to take that as permission to do whatever the hell they want. Like. Well if Robin who's fighting for us and whatever is breaking the law to do it then hey why shouldn't we and that directly contrast with the interview that we started the episode with? Or someone was asking her about the riots and she said she did not condone rioting. She understands how people are upset, but she really wants people to take that to The Ballot Box and to vote and to really stick together and we get a little bit more of that in her speech before everything goes to hell individually. We're strong together. We are unstoppable. So I don't think she's gonna go completely Lawless on this one. I think we may step up Acts of Civil Disobedience and try to remember what it's called where there's stupid laws and you follow them. So rigidly it becomes an inconvenience for everyone else. It's I think it's called malicious compliance. Now, it's it's a thing my favorite example of malicious compliance is someone getting ticketed for not riding their In the bike lane despite the fact that there is all sorts of garbage cans and cars in the bike lane. So he just crashes into every single obstacle including the police car of the cop that ticketed him for not riding his bike in the bike lane. So it's it's that sort of thing. It's going out of your way to follow a law to prove how completely pants on head stupid that law actually is and so I can see Civil Disobedience. I can see malicious compliance. I can see a lot of rallying and speech each has and trying to keep the people together because obviously things falling apart like this is not what she wants like. I do think she honestly does want what's best for people and I don't think she's going to go completely Lawless to get it. I think she's smarter than that Mark. So I think that she saw everything. Whoa, we're dealing with a Robin Hood analog and one of robins. Most sort of I guess advertised Feats other than the Rob to the rich and give to the poor is his archery skills. And what do you need for Archer? You need a Keen Eye what if her semblance is something related to site that gives her for people who know what I'm saying true sight and she could see or she has dark or she has dark vision. Maybe she's a fondness and we don't know what so she can see in the dark but there's I think that she there. More happening than she's letting on and with the the fracas and the commotion. She just wanted to make sure that everybody that she could make sure is all right was all right. So I think that she saw Tyrion and tried to do as much as she could but with how the camera was we couldn't see what you she was trying to make sure that the Hunter and says we're safe and etc, etc. But I think ultimately she's going to go up against Jacques and whoever tends to follow her in that assailing of Shinee does corp corp. Oh, I think she's going to be able to better trust those people not inherently, but just be like, okay if we're all in this together, then it seems like it seems like we're all in the same team Mark. I'm going to hop back into conspiracy Corner real quick. Pour myself a quick shot take the shot and then yell excitedly guys. What if Robin is a fox faunus? Oh my God. I mean, that'd be pretty on the nose and her hair is hiding her ears. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I love it. Nobody can convince me. Otherwise until proven until proven one way or another. If we get a Mouse Detective fauna, then I think it's definitely in the realm of possibility fingers crossed. I hope so. Anyway, I like what you guys are saying, I think since again this whole episode is reliant on the Real World experience of people who lived through the 2016 election. I think we're going to be seeing other similar parallels in terms of You know the schnee dust Corporation and potentially even the entire Council because the the council itself was described as week. So I could definitely see the entire Council as a whole bending to Jacques and having them basically say that things that aren't true are true and you know that has they won't refer to it as such but like the existence of alternative facts. And how basically basically an assault on reality is what is what we might be seeing and the best way to combat that is by believing, you know again tying back to that opening is believing in love and never never ceasing to stride for things to get better because that's what we have to do. And yeah whether that's acts of Civil Disobedience or Using the law to your advantage things like that or occasionally, you know in the case of Robin Hood choosing what laws not to obey and whether you know, because we've seen a lot of civil disobedience in the real world and a lot of people getting arrested for protests and things like that. So I'm sure things like that will escalate as far as mantle goes, but I have to concur I think Robin smart and something that's worth noting is that Ruby cried out before the lights went out and so I feel like Robin knows Penny well enough to know that this is out of character and she's smart enough to know that she did have this in the bag and she's smart enough to know that somebody cried out before the lights went out and Penny wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary or untoward when Lights were still on. So I feel like Robin smart enough to know that something isn't quite right here. Whether or not she's going to immediately want to work with iron wood and Company that's another thing altogether. But ultimately I think she's smart enough to know that things aren't quite as they seem here. So since we've already sort of started talking about it. Let's talk about it Watson Siri and Watson Tyrion, you know basically work together Watts hacks the election and It's also potentially possible that he's hacked Penny as well. And because there is a moment when Tyrion is engaging in his attack and he disappears from her line of sight now does he or does he not have who does this is this potentially going to lead to a Terminator scenario is what I'm asking here and if that's the case, why didn't he just make tenth penny? Any go Rogue here and now let's go ahead and start with Mark. Yeah, that's that's exactly why I think if he can do that he I think he's working to that ultimately and there will be a time where he can take over Penny, but for this if he could have he would have but now that you he's putting out the Deep fake it it just leaves the Avenue open for a more public display of something that to be taken out of. And to a the nth degree of Penny being this terrible person and I think that's the main reason why he didn't do it. Yeah, that was definitely that upload sign at the very end there and hit the the mocap of like the penny he Avatar he had their yeah, I deep fake is the best way to put it Well Done Mark Stacy, I don't know. What do you think I think walks, isn't it for the draw? And so whether he can hack her right now and chose not to or is going to be able to do it later. Is potentially just him going. Oh, no, we're going to make it look like it's her but have her like futilely trying to protect yourself and prove that she's good and helpful and on the right side and then just as she's you know, beginning to gain back the trust of some of the key figures, you know, Robin, for example, then flip the switch take her over make it dramatic. Katie personally for me. It's going to hinge on how did he manage to hide Tyrion from her sight in the first place is this he got into her sensors somehow is this was able to release some sort of frequency was Tyrion. Did Tyrion have a device on his person that watts would have been able to tune to Penny's frequency and just hide him like how exactly did this work is my question and the answer to That is going to answer whether or not I leaned into more of a Terminator Theory or not. What I'm interested in is did we see Tyrion semblance here? Because when we saw him attack Fiona, it was a one hit or a break and we saw that his blades were glowing purple when he hit her. So that's my question. Is that something that he can do? Is it something that works with his weapon like Adam? It's did because he went she was ready for battle and he went straight through her Aura and I don't really believe that the power imbalance would be that big between them. So I'm more focused on like did we just see his semblance did we see a little more of what Tyrion can do it seems like it like I got the impression that the more of his Aura he puts into sort of the breaking point the Stronger of an aura he can break. However that leaves however much he sort of dilutes it into that one area that leaves the rest of him open to attack. That's that's what it seemed like to me after a couple of viewings and conspiracy strolls down Twitter search engine. So it's the difference between stepping on someone's foot while you're wearing tennis shoes and stepping on someone's foot while you're wearing high heels all of the pressure put in one very specific point. Yeah, that's what it seems like it seems reasonable to me for sure. And can we just drill down on the fact that this is the second time these assholes have used Penny to instill fear and Terror in society like come on guys and you know that being said that's the second time rule of Threes no poor Penny well and Both laugh not quite for my parallel sake but when you mentioned that it felt like the end of volume 3 part of the lead up to the end of volume 3 was that bit in the vital tournament where Emerald messed with what Yang was seeing and it turned into what looked like an unprovoked attack on Mercury here. We have Watts messing with what penny can see and using the resulting video footage to make it look like an unprovoked attack on Robin. Extremely similar tactics slightly different methodology. Yep, and let's hope it doesn't end up in the same result because I don't think it's necessarily a coincidence that this is all happening. Not only win an election is happening. But when Ironwood is dead-set and devoting so much time and resources to re-establishing communication between the kingdoms. I don't think that's a coincidence. We just need to burn em. Arena to the ground that thing brings bad luck more so than Crow. There's too much dust in it would be really dangerous. Actually now that you say that that tells me that this gives me an idea that Jacques is going to get iron Woods to council seats back so that he has tripled the power or somebody's going to provide a vote of no confidence and having him be the supreme leader, but that's a different movie. Right? So I think that Jacques is going to override everybody's Authority find a midi Arena and similarly to my prediction a couple of episodes weaponize it. Oh God, that's terrible. Ervil, fuck that guy. Can we just I do want to point out that Jacques immediately when the lights came back on the results came up and Penny standing there in front of all those dead and very injured people that Jacques, you know it immediately cut to Jacques giving his acceptance speech and victory speech how much you want to bet that if we cut to a wide shot of that party that there'd be like maybe 12 people there and he'd be like it was the largest Victory party that was ever in the history of Atlas. You don't know you weren't there. Yeah, because no one was there question millions of people there. He said so that's kind of where we leave things is everybody's injured the happy huntresses have not so happy right now opposite of that. There is more mistrust towards the Aesop's and Ironwood than there has ever been and Grim are officially running rampant through the entire area and poor marrow, even though he protest and says hey this wasn't us it is kind of irrelevant because they've got a long night ahead of him as as he put it at the end of the episode and Penny is on her way back to Atlas whether or not she'll actually make it there before getting hacked again who even knows so things we leave this episode off in a pretty dire place. And yeah, what does this mean for the rest of the the season? What does this mean for our characters? How do we feel about the way this episode ended? Let's go ahead and start with Katie. Well for one, I don't think Penny's going back to Atlas. I think she's going home to Dad or she's going out into the streets to try to help fight off Grim because she's the protector of mantle and that's what she does like one of the two. I don't think He's going back somewhere to lay low, that's that's not who she is. I do really appreciate that. The last shot of this episode was Grim flying through the streets closed up on the Grim while still hearing Jaques acceptance speech echoing in the background. Like that was perfect horrifying, but perfect. I really want next episode to open with like Grim getting into the dance club or groom getting into the movie theater. Her like just like almost Landshark sort of situational comedy except it's actually terrible. But yeah, this is this is going to be bad. It's going to be a really long night. It's gonna be a really ugly aftermath the next morning and it's gonna be a really long four-year what I think for me the main thing about how this episode ended is the Grim coming in and attacking the city is very much how it felt. At the time that's just a mode like it if there was an emotional manifestation of how I felt at the when the election happened Graham attacking the city is a great analog. Anyway, how about you Stacey? Yeah this ending I'm it was absolutely beautifully done like just capturing the horror of what was happening with the like Joyful, acceptance speech going on in the background. You're right Megan. This is this is exactly how I felt too. this was the manifestation of how dire things feel and I think it was perfectly encapsulated and knowing we just have a long uphill battle now. And having to stand up and face it some of the most intense endings to an episode. I think we've gotten over all yeah the seasons far from over. How about you mark despite the season being far from over? I think they're I wonder instead. I wonder if the next two episodes are the before the storm. We have one night at the club and one it. The movie theater when you have wonderful experiences or not. So wonderful experiences between all of our characters and each episode ends with Boom the aftermath and then the subsequent pick up after those two episodes will be dealing with this however long it takes and it may take their maybe not the rest of the season but depending on how they end the season and I know we have we have a lot more it I I I think that this storyline and this particular evening could go on and it could be sort of a feeling of yeah this type of feeling it does go on. It doesn't just end and it doesn't it doesn't stop it sort of a thing that everybody's been dealing with day-to-day but the night felt like it was forever. So I'm going off of what everybody else was saying about it in terms of the analog, but I Wonder if Penny can attract Grim just by her nature and by her design. So I wonder if she then becomes a magnet or a beacon for lack of a better term and I really I hope that we get some good feeling soon because it's going to be pretty dire at least for a while. I think that's a really good way of putting it and I think you know I keep talking about the opening of this season. I think that the positive thing that's going to get us through these dark times both in the show. And in the real world is with the people that we love, you know, believing in love and with the support of the people who care about you and who you care about in return. That's what's ultimately going to get us through the night and you know again talking about how they Rooster Teeth has taken this very real world thing that has rocked our country to its core and taken taken that and make made it a deliberate plot point. I feel like you know, this is kind of their way of working through it to and And and taking us all with them. Well, no because like this is also like more of like we're all in this together. Like I don't know whether or not if things had gone differently in 2016. If we'd be seeing, you know, Jacques running for Council or whatever and like I don't know if these same story beats would be the way Ruby was playing out ultimately. I don't think it necessarily matters because I think where we're going is You know, ultimately still I feel like the message is the same. In that you know that same hopeful inspiration in the womb of overwhelming defeat. It's just sort of the route that we're taking to get there. And I also don't necessarily think it's a coincidence that we have a group called The Aesop's in this volume either because Aesop's Fables were all about trying to impart a lesson. And I feel like you know for people who are like, oh why they have to being bring politics into this. Why does this why do we have to be talking about politics right now? It's because stories are and always have been a way of conveying messages. And like I said, I don't think it's a coincidence that the Aesop's are here because I feel like this volume has a very specific moral it wants to teach the world. So I don't know do we That's kind of me just on my little soapbox here. Do we have any thoughts our feelings about the the way this episode played out or details? We might have skipped over a little bit anything else. We want to talk about. Let's start with Katie mom still in the leave me here to die corner. So we'll see you next week goes Is that the where the bar is located at in conspiracy corner? That's where the bar used to be. No, no, no. No, the bar has moved. The bar does not like the sadness. Oh believe me here to die corner is not a happy Corner. Oh, it's under the stairs. That's what happens when you fall out of the level off to Halt Stacy. How about you just be trying to climb back into the love Loft and stay there instead. It's a spiral staircase do be careful. Better than staying down there things that always how about you Mark? I'm bolted to the floor. But I did want to bring up two things that were said in response or one thing that was in response to last week's video a video. Wow, where that's where we still are last week's episode. I kind of said as a joke that I thought Cobalts representation was of this blue. I'm Blue but it supposedly Ivory and Cobalt are the the sweater meme where some people see it as white and gold and some people see it as black and blue the dress. Yeah, the dress wait for real supposedly. That's what it is. That's the best thing I've heard all week. Okay, but that makes sense because ones trumpet player and ones Nyan Cat. Yeah, it's me. It's the meme team there memes did that Meme exist back in season 3 or do we not care about that Natick it existed a fair number of years ago could have to look that up either what happen is that I'm gonna look it up now good because we'll need a break after the sad thing other folks have brought up that some of the dead and injured at the party were some of the moms from from the crosswalk and whether it's a uh, not on purpose thing of utilizing these Actors in this way to further this story and then possibly playing into Jean not being so shining of a night or if they were just models that they were using is yet to be seen and I guess we'll find out next episode. Yeah, has that corner there Katie? It's fucking great man. It's just it's perfect. There's Shadows. There's a little blankets. I'm crying a lot. So there's a box of tissues but it's almost out because this is a drama at It's just it's hard. I actually really love that as like an additional personal thing for Jean. It's a nice little fuck you. Is it in terms of like personal Stakes? I find that interesting Mark. Apparently the dress photograph that became a viral internet sensation on the 26th of February of 2015. That was that was the year. It happened. So what volume were we talking about at the beginning of 2015 season 3 was seasoned Yeah, no, no is the end of 2015. So that would have been Yankee fresh that would attract. That would attract. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yeah, especially considering the Breakneck Pace at especially considering the Breakneck Pace at which the first few volumes were made. Yeah. Well, I'm glad we've gotten to the bottom of that mystery. The only other thing I want to say, is that like You know, we talked a lot about like our feelings and how this episode wrecked us and reliving all of those 2016 election memories is kind of devastating in a lot of way if it was devastating for you, you know, don't be afraid of taking care of yourself. Like we choked but like in the love Loft, I do have like blankets and Cups of Tea and Other other sort of cozy things. It's like it's like a little B&B up there. So guys don't hesitate to take care of yourself because the world is dark and full of Terror and we are nowhere near through the end of the woods just yet. And so it's Important to continue fighting for what's right and it's important to continue looking on the bright side of things and never never ceasing to strive for that better world, but also acknowledge that sometimes you need to take care of yourself too before you can get back into the fight. So self-care is super super important. So definitely take care of yourself and never stop fighting the good fight. Right. All right.

Yeah, I just woke up this morning ready to do a podcast and it's been a long time. I'm sure we'll get into why it's been so long. I can't imagine that's not going to be a part of this podcast, but we'll see and so before we go any further, let's listen to the song and of course I have to say, I'm sure the biggest reason why this song came up as the song recession that wanted to happen. Today is because it's number one in urban AC radio what y'all say? The way that he looks at me when he holds my hand. He wants and everyone know, I'm his woman. Then he is my man.

He touches my song. He's giving me love. So stay stay stay. I am never mad at me and I want it to be his life and then he came. It's unnatural to make a light because he's a perfect compliment because I'm embossing my world. But when we're together, he just makes me feel like his girl. He's giving me love so steady. He touches my heart now. I'm ready. He touches my soul. He's giving me love. So Stan I Wanna Be lovers and friends and mother his children make breakfast on Sunday and fighting than make up.

He touches my soul my spirit. He's giving me love so steady. He's giving me love so. That is steady love from my eighth album worthy. So, you know, I'm going to do it. Here we go. I have eight albums acoustic Soul Voyage to India testimony vol.1 life and relationship testimony volume to love and politics song recession song Precision medicine. India Arie and Joe Sample Christmas with friends and now February 20 19. We're leasing worthy. I really don't even know where to start with this. But let me just address the elephant in the room and let's talk about the video real quick. So I have known David Banner Loosely just from music industry circles. But when I first came into the industry, I was nervous all the time. There was a lot I didn't understand about myself if I was 25 years old. My first album came out. So I was learning a lot of the basics about myself. But what I'm referring to right now is learning that I am an empath meaning a person who absorbs the energy around them readily absorbs the energy around them. And so when I came into the music industry, I was always really on edge because there were so many energies around. Mound and what I understand now so many competing energies and disharmonious energies and I mean that I feel like a lot of the people were out of harmony with themselves, but also out of harmony with G with each other so there was like a lot of disharmonious energies around and so I was always exhausted and feeling anxious. And so whenever I would be with the person who felt who's in She felt good to me. They stood out and so actually having said that this might come as a surprise to you just based on his image, but one of the people that stood out to me in the very beginning was P Diddy. I did the MTV Music Awards and that won that award show was always known for being kind of like wild. I did it with John Mellencamp. We did a song together called peaceful world. So they I wasn't invited to that show, but he was and I was there to sing with him and You know things are a lot Wilder now. This is probably 2001. This was 2001 when we did this song and things are a lot Wilder now and all the shows are wild people where see through clothes and you know thongs on TV and twerk and cuss and you know, all kind of shit. I said that on purpose like that but back then it wasn't really like that just yet. And so that music awards was kind of like the wild one and I was uncomfortable. Well there because I'm more comfortable in a calmer environments. It's just how I am and puffy was having a after-party and the way he spoke to me just made me feel good. I like this energy. Remember that day. He said you're good and you're different and that's a beautiful combination. Nobody had ever really said that to me like that. Anyway back to David Banner. So because of how things were and how I was and what I was learning, I would see he's one of the people that I would see and I would think I like that energy. I didn't wasn't that I thought he was handsome or none of that. I just liked his energy Snoop Dogg was one of those people Joe the R&B singer Joe was one of those people. I mean, I guess I can't remember everyone now Patti LaBelle was always one of those people I would say she's the original person Stevie Wonder was one of those people, you know, I can't remember everyone now some more names come to mind. I'll tell you but David Banner was one of those people and what I found fascinating about him was that his music was the exact opposite his music made me feel so anxious. It was raunchy and graphic and all the stuff that I actually was the poet was actually the polar opposite energy of everything. I stood for and so but I didn't There was music when I first started seeing this very bright light man who would be in the room sometimes but when I was working on my album Testimony vol 1 I reached out to him to do a guest appearance on My Song Psalms 23, which ended up featuring MC Lyte, but I reached out to him first and also we were on Motown together. So I reached out to my dearly departed friend Elise right to see if she would ask him if he would feature on my album. He had just released the album and so I listened to it and when I heard this Songs I thought I can't have this person on my album. And so, you know, we're all back then. I found it really fascinating that he could have such a bright energy and music that could be so crazy to me. This is all my opinion of course, but it's how I saw it. But you know, I understand now we're all multifaceted were all what's that word contradictory beings. I am too just as much as anybody else. I just do my contradiction more quietly, you know, I've done Little bit of self-destructive things all that. I just do it in private or should I say I have done it in private when I was that way. I'm a lot more grounded now, but that's because I got out of my system. But anyway going back to the point. So David Banner when the album worthy came out my ideal and still is my ideal. In fact was to do for videos. That was Arc about the relationship Journey. And so it started with that magic and I had the closest thing. I have to a celebrity Crush lyric bent as the lead man in that video and so for steady love I had someone else in mind who got stuck on movie set and couldn't come and so four days before the video. I reached out to David Banner because I had him in mind for the final video of the arc. And he said yes, and I've one of the things I've come to learn about David Banner is that he moves fast and he stays in constant movement when I reached out to him about the video. I didn't know that about him. I just I thought it couldn't hurt to ask. All he could say was no but he said yes, and I said well don't you want to hear the song? He said yes in the song through but he said yes before I even sent the song and he showed up on set and I was nervous because Didn't really know each other. I just knew that he was a bright light. Also, I have to say that you know, anyone who follows him knows he's gone through his own personal Evolution and he's for his own reasons. You can listen to his podcast if you want to hear him talk about it, but for his own reasons, he's developed a more spiritual develop the spiritual part of his life and so he I would see him on occasion. Ian and he would always say if you ever need me I'm here. And so I saw him in March at The Trumpet Awards where I got to sing my song what if during Black History Month and he came down the hall and he took my hand he bowed to me which I'm a sucker for and he said if you ever need me I'm here. And so when it was time to do this video, I thought let me see if he can show up and four days later. He did. We shot the video in Nashville and he came and He was a joy to be with on set. He was a strong energy a strong presence. He knew what he wanted and because his presence was so strong. I followed his lead on a lot of things but also one of the things I learned about him that day was that he's done 27 movies. And so since he's been in front of the camera a lot I decided it couldn't hurt to follow his lead, but also, I think when you invited man to do something you got to give him some leadership wait some leadership power and I did and I'm glad I did because he taught me a lot. So there's a scene where we argue on set and he said he would go he would shoot something and then go back and look at this the camera every time and so that was actually inspiration to because normally when I do things I don't go back and look at the camera because I'm not in movies and the director always would seem like irritated like you have to look every time they don't say that but they always would give a Vibe like if she comes looking again. He would just walk over there and look and they didn't say anything. So I'm always going to go back and look at every take now because these videos are mine. But anyway, but I'm having said that he would go back and look at the takes and he would report back to me. And so in that fight scene. He said you have like a hint of a smirk on your face. Oh, I do because you know, I was amused I loved being with him in that way. And so I took that smirk right off my face when he said it and he also said you got to start the scene before it starts. So, you know, you're Off to the side you're mad inside you're arguing inside. You've already been through the stuff inside and then she says action you're in it. You don't start when she says action and so that helped me to get this smirk off my face too. And so there was a lot of stuff like that that he was able to coach me through and I love that. You know, I don't know. I think that also it helped that I had my my friend my best friend to help me run my company so bird. I consider her the CCO Chief creative officer of Solberg. And so she had a talk with him before we got on set because I was like, can you just help me smooth? This over is the same thing with that magic video. Like I invite this gorgeous man, and then he shows up and I don't know what to do. And so she had to talk with him and he said no she's in good hands and she came to me and she said this is going to be great and I trust her instincts. And so when she said that I got onto set very comfortable and actually David came into my space and had his makeup done. And so I think he came into my space intentionally so that we could be sure to like kind of mingle in Jeez, and he's an interesting dude. He's very authoritative. And so the Glam Squad was in my room and he said can everybody leave. I wanted to have a talk with the queen and so they all left in, you know, we held hands and he looked into my eyes and he said, you know, I'm here for you. Thank you for inviting me. I want you to know you're in good hands. It's going to be a beautiful day or stuff like that. I remember exactly what he said and I said the same thing to him. I said, I'm a supporter of yours an admirer of yours. I'm happy that you're here and I said I'm I'm getting a feeling that I'm glad my other friend couldn't do this because this feels just right for even got on set. And so we got on set and we started doing the scene with the pancakes and the director said okay turn around and kiss him. She's from Australia turn around and kiss him and for a split second in my head. I was like oh shit, but that's what second past and I turned around and I kissed him and it felt so comfortable and at ease that I knew I was in good hands. That day and we went on to shoot our video and every time she would say turn around and kiss him. I would do it gladly. And so anybody who's wondering his lips felt nice his breath smells good. His hands felt good. It felt good to be in the arms of somebody. Who's that sighs. I'm not really a big person, but I'm also not small and in my energy is very big and so he was big enough to hold my energy and I like to all of that we laughed we have fun. Soon as the video was done. He got in the car and flew home. And so I guess we finally got to the elephant in the room. Anybody who's wondering if we're actual couple. I will say this. We were not a couple at that point. We were friends. We were getting to know each other at that point and we've developed a nice friendship and relationship since then. Yeah, so I want to talk a lot more about the song in this next segment. So the song steady love was co-written by myself and the executive producer of the album worthy. His name is Erin Lindsay. You heard me talk about him on that magic episode. But Erin Lindsay comes from the Gospel World and I'm the first non gospel artist that he's worked with on a full project. He also did my Christmas album. You probably heard me say his name on the episode. I did a year ago. I can't believe it's been a year. Song for station favorite time of year and he's brilliant. He's a brilliant Lyricist singer producer. Sometimes producers don't write lyrics and he does it all and so he had this concept for steady love while we were working on the Christmas album and I never could forget about it. And so when we were doing that were the album I said, can we do that song? And obviously he said yes, and so during the making of worthy which was from 20 was all 2017 and all of 2018. We worked on this song and a big part of the reason why I couldn't forget about the song is because I was in a relationship with someone for those two years and everything that I said in this song is how he made me feel and how I saw him that relationship has since Of course, you probably heard me talk about that in conversation that magic but you can go back and listen to any time. I'm not going to go deeply into my feelings about that relationship and all that but I will say even though it ran its course for the time that we were together. This song is exactly how you made me feel I couldn't just make this stuff up out of thin air. This is how he made me feel he's a good father. He's a good cook. He loves his basketball. He loves a good book. I tell you how I know. He's the perfect one for Because he's a warrior in the streets, but he's a king in their sheets. That's how I felt about him. And I have to say one of the things I've learned from that relationship is that and I'm I'm not like full grown in my early 40s and I'm just now getting here where I'm learning that I can't go into relationships thinking that they're all going to last forever. I have to go into the relationship knowing that it's a lesson and a journey and to get the most out of it. And so For me, it didn't have to be a 15 year long relationship that started with marriage to Be steady. Now, I have to say this Erin's been married for I think 18 years with three children and so he does have that quintessential steady love and so I'm thankful that we were able to put our minds together to create this song steady love and to create this story it because at its Essence study love is a song about mint Because of life's going to be crazy. Anyway, I want to do it with him. This is a song about commitment and again, although that the relationship did not end in marriage it started with the commitment and we were committed to the end. I'm not going to even lie. It got crazy at the end. It really did but this is the first long-term relationship. I've been in that I was not completely torn up about when it ended. I'm not saying I wasn't I was hurt and I was devastated and I hated the way that it ended and I hated how upset we were with each other at the end. But this year last time this time last year. I went home for Christmas and when I came home from Christmas, I decided to have a staycation in my condo and I literally got on the floor. I bought this little bean bag thing and I sat on the floor on my yoga mat on the bean bag from December 26th of January 7th. I didn't watch TV. I didn't do any internet stuff. I just wrote read meditated thought prayed. I have some phone conversations with some of my favorite thinkers and spiritual teachers and mentors and they guided me actually had four. I am guided meditation and conversation with my friend queen of Hua who I got to know when I lived in New York and she's like you a mutual friend of the man. I was in a relationship with and I Mutual influence and friend and so I called her and she we did a guided meditation. That was great turning point and matter of fact that was on the 27th of December. And so that was a nice. taking off point for the healing of that relationship and by the time I emerge January 7th, I was Free of the pain and thank grateful for the lessons and ready to rebuild myself because there's a lot of financial stuff involved in that relationship. And so I had to rebuild my finances and so always in alignment though because I had album coming out my album came out February 15th, and so about a month from the day. I got up off the floor. I was releasing my album. What are the into the world and then I went on tour and that helped me to reveal my finances and it helped me to focus on my life my future instead of my past and this is going to be strange to say but that whole tour a lot of those songs were about that relationship, but I didn't think about him when I sang the songs on stage. What I thought about was the audience and I thought about my relationship Journey as a whole. Because at this point I've been in a few long-term relationships and I thought about it more in general with the lessons and I think it's a good place to be I can certainly say I feel good about things and every time I say a year ago, it feels strange because this year flew by 2018 felt long. Hope the end of that relationship with the passing away of my beloved blue Miller with all the struggle to get the out. Done and moving and I lived in all these different places at the same time. I talked a little bit about that in song for station the worthy tour. I think I also talked about in soccer station that magic I can't remember which episodes at detailed. I talked about moving into a new house and all the stuff that went with that and so I was scattered and heartbroken and heartbroken over blue devastated over blue and struggling and struggling with all this stuff and it made the year feel really long 2019. I was busy. I went through some hard stuff. I will talk about that in a minute, but it felt so fast from last December to this December today as I'm sitting here recording song for Sation steady love it is December 11th is the new moon on December 11, and just knowing that it was all here. Go is wild but it was and so I think that now is a good time to talk about what it felt like to tour with this song steady love so let's get into that in this next segment. So this year I did two tours one in the spring one of the Fall just a moment ago. I said, I can't remember which episode I talked about what in but there's one very memorable episode for me. And that is the last one which was song relation the worthy tour because I did that episode because I needed someplace to put all of my feelings all of my hurt feelings all of my wild and excited experiences. About the tour and after that tour I said to myself. I don't know if I'm going to do any more touring you can go back and listen to that episode and you'll understand exactly why I said that I also released this viral video. I'm sorry a video that went viral of me talking in my car. I call it song recession song for Sation the pieces I am had to think about that for a second. I called it song for station the pieces I am because I had just come from seeing the Toni Morrison documentary of the same name and it really struck me in a lot of ways but what I really was responding to and what I really was hurt by was the depth of her struggle and how much it had to do with gender and race that even the great tone. Morrison had to overcome the struggles of gender and race in the Judgment of all these white men to be able to create her world changing world class history-making literature. Even her so made me wonder what chance do I have and so when I saw the documentary I had just come off to her and I started sharing how I felt extremely underpaid and under seen and I think at that time the reason why I did something I rarely do which is pull out my phone and talking to my phone. I think the reason why I did that is because I wanted my painting truth to be witnessed because the truth is that For me and a lot of other people. I know I'm not the only person I ever heard say this the music industry is almost emotionally abusive like all this stuff happens that is blatantly sexist and racist and then they tell you if you say anything about it, you might not get what you're trying to get. So don't say anything and it's crazy to abuse the person and tell them not to say anything and so it was a radical act for me to just speak. And say how I feel especially when it's something that is critical of the industry. I'm in and fearing that perhaps it will put me even further down the line of someone who should receive their just due and so that's probably the real reason why I picked up my phone to make that video that day because Toni Morrison was a person who spoke up if you saw the documentary you saw her speak up and I feel like I've reached a point in my life and my future Charity where I can say what I want to say and so I've been saying what I want to say and so in that video that day I said I may not tour again and I meant ever again. That was in July and then September came and I went back on tour. I felt strong enough. I felt like I had talked to my team enough. I felt that they heard me and that we were going to be able to do this and the saddest thing happened and it is that all the stuff that I was so hurt by in the first tour in the spring all that stuff picked up where it left off the logistics of the tour that is Actually, someone else's job the logistics of the tour were not taken care of and I had to suffer through so much while at the same time being soft enough to do my performances and it was hard. I feel like it aged me it hurt me and made me want to quit and you know, I thought if it's going to be like this, I'm not doing this shit and I got out on the tour starting September 15th and my favorite cities, Seattle. And everything picked up where it left off. Things were not in order the logistics were a mess. And I had to struggle through it. And so the first show in Tacoma Washington before the show. I had a complete sheer utter meltdown because I felt so hurt and disrespected and I felt like my greatest fear had come true and I was under so much pressure that I was trying to deliver for the fans because I do a VIP meet and greet before the show and I could not pull it together, but I still walked out onto that stage and tried to do the VIP meet and greet and soon as I opened my mouth to start singing. I started crying because singing is nothing but emoting for me and if I have some other emotions on top those are going to come out first and so I'm not again I'm not going to go out too far into this. The reason why I was so devastated in that moment was because of the lack of respect but also in that very moment. It was a lack of support because I have a team that helps me get on stage every day and I didn't know until I got out onto the road that some of the team wasn't going to be there because the people that I trusted and paid to do the logistics didn't give me all the information so I get there and I'm kind of alone getting myself on stage. I can do it, but I need to know in advance so that I have all the tools to do it. I didn't have the tools. I'm trying to get on stage. I'm trying to serve my VIP and I break down sobbing and what I know and have learned about myself is that I cannot hold things in and so I sat the the offending ice at the offending a precise at the offending parties that were present down because some of them weren't on the road and that's probably why they mess shit up because they're not out there but the offending parties who were there. I sat them. Now we had a conversation in the conversation was very fulfilling for me and for them we both cried and then I called my mother and she was able to calm me down and you know, my mother and I have a close relationship but she's not the person I go to take care of my emotions. I had to learn that in my adult life that she's not that for me. She's other things my mother's of my backbone, but when I'm like need someone to take care of my emotions She's not the one but I was so I mean I was completely out of it to the place to the point where my face turned a different color because when I came back to my stylist is my assistant both asked me did you fix your makeup? And I said no. I just the color came back to my face and that that's a real story. And so I said that all to say when I called my mother. Because even though she's not my soft place to land every time when shit really hits the fan. She's the one and so I called her and I was sobbing and she said what's wrong like she was panicked and I started telling her that things weren't right and she preyed on my mother so funny. There's this thing that she says when she's about to go into a very potent prayer and she says she says, okay Holy Spirit. Okay God this is easy for you. So she started praying and Ended somewhat sometimes at some point in the prayer. She said India's music heals. So many people let it heal her today. I've never heard her say that before and I never thought of it that way and I got calm and it's like my brain came into a different state like my eyes could see things different I could hear again. I don't know how to explain it, but I calmed down I came to the color came back to my face and I got ready for the show and I I told the audience that I had a meltdown earlier that day. I apologize to my VIP. We did our VIP meet and greet after the show. And I went on to have you know a fine show. I said all of this because I had to paint the picture of how healing these songs really are for me and while steady love is the single and it's a hit song at radio. It's not really the song that gets the most reaction from audience. And it's actually hard to say what song does get the most reaction because different regions of the country react different ways. If you want to hear more about that again, you can listen to songs or Sation worthy episode 14, but what I can say is that we would play study love nearing the end of the show and it was always a light moment a big part of my song for Sation worthy tour. Is the screen which has quotes and images and some videos and during the show, we would play the steady Love video and we would often do that magic and steady love back to back. So it was a lot of eye candy on that screen. And so we would play the video for steady love and the audience would just be like they would get like to like, you know, we would go we gotta go a lot of places in my song relation. We start with a prayer we ground ourselves. Some of the songs are you know, really heartfelt and quiet some of the songs. I whisper icing this quiet on some songs and some of them are loud and some of them are old school. Some of them are new and some of them were hits and some of them were fan favorites and all kinds of different stuff, but then I would get to steady love and it was like people would just feel like hey, you know, I guess my jam Am I rocking the hips and this before it was big a tradie. This is before it was number one at radio. And so my stylist her name is Jolene Coggins. She does a lot of the videos that you see on my Instagram like a lot of the best ones of me from behind or her taking pictures of my booty. Those are Julian's she's my stylist. Like I said, and she said I feel like something big is happening right under our nose and I felt it too and one of those things with was that the song was going up the charts and so but before we knew it was Gonna hit number one before I even knew it was climbing the charts like that. It was like a party would interrupt every time he would sing steady love and that's really what I would think about I would not think about the relationship. I would just think about the people and what it means to be grown-ups who have been in and out of different relationships and how it feels and how we heal and how we try again and how we still continue to believe in commitment and love even though we've been hurting, you know, obviously I think about the general the generalities of Being Human And in love and out of love and trying again and stuff like that, but people would kick it like it would be like boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Look what happened hands in the air and rocking and dancing and I always always love that because it brought the Journey full circle from coming out the audience screaming. We sing a big song We ground ourselves we go to all these places emotionally and we come out at the end light and knowing that you know, even though we go through all this crazy stuff. It's always going to be okay because that's really what life is like and you know, I've been through as much pain as anybody else even 2018 losing blue, but I always feel like life is ups and downs and so you're going to be up again and you're going to be down again and allowing for the dynamic nature of life. Makes it possible to have a fundamental base of well-being because you know when it's wrong is not bad and when it's good, it's not forever in that. It's all a part of life. It took me a long time to learn that but I get it now and so it was like steady love was the book end to beginning the song for station worthy tour with the song. I Am light that talk. About us, you know being a understanding our self-worth and our Beauty and our light despite all the darkness that is in and around all of us. It's like the show would take a journey Arc from hey, we're all okay, even though we go through all this stuff and in the end, let's just party and celebrate life and that's what steady love always felt like in concert and it's what it feels like to me personally when I really think about my own Journey. And that every every significant relationship I've been in has ended but I'm sitting here smiling now because this last relationship taught me that I can come out of it and I can be okay. It does not going to take me 5 years 10 years to heal from it. I can say okay. These are my lessons. Let me deal with the pain. Let me cry it out and let me get up and keep moving and so, you know at the end of the day study love is about commitment and I'm sure I will commit. Again, I know I will God will bring somebody else that I feel that way about into my life. And so I look forward to that. So what else do I want to say about steady love? Let's get into that in this next segment. You know, this is an honor of our beloved National Treasure the one of the greatest songwriters of all time Stevie Wonder. I think I've said this is one of the song relations before I heard Berry Gordy giving a speech about Stevie Wonder and he said I was it was in person. I was in the room and he was talking about Stevie and he said there are some artists that come every decade. There's out some artists that come every Hundred years and there are some artists that come just once in Stevie Wonder is one of those artists that come just once and so at the end of The Fall Song for Sation tour in the west coast after everything I had been through and I mean it was a lot. Let me just say this to about the West Coast tour it almost ended because we did the first two shows in Washington state and then we went to four Mentos and then somehow somebody allowed the itinerary to include me flying into Sacramento the day of the show and then I was supposed to fly to LA today of the show and then I was supposed to fly to Phoenix Arizona the day of the show. Now the people I work with I've been working with this with them since the fall of 2015 and I've never gone into any performance the day of never I always get in at least the day before if not two days before to ground myself. Because I'm slow moving in that way and the fact that they had this itinerary this way. I thought I have to honor myself. And so either they're going to fix this or I'm going home and that's saying a lot because I love my fans. I love this album worthy. I love this iteration of the tour and everything we've developed it into I love it. And so the idea of saying this is hurting me enough that I will go home is big and instead of going home. They chartered to private planes so that I was able able to do the shows and so from the Meltdown of that first show to the fabulous La show. That was my favorite show which lyric bent attended that show and we played the that magic video in front of him. I was my goal to embarrass him. I think I did that sufficiently and the show ended in San Diego on September 30th, and my birthday is October 3rd. And so if you know me, you know I go hard for my Day, there's a very authentic feeling of just being lit up from the inside that comes over me around my birthday. Always I always feel that way all the way through Libra sees and I just feel really alive and like effervescent and incandescent and and like the most blessed person ever and most My Most Blessed time of year. And so my birthday was coming and I knew that I could do almost anything that I wanted for my birthday because I I live by design a life that is very free. And I couldn't think of where to go. I didn't have any time to plan anything because the tour took up all my energy all my bandwidth. I couldn't plan something on a whim because there was nothing in my heart that I just knew I wanted to go do in the past. I spent a lot of time in Hawaii, but Hawaii's different a lot of things on the Earth are different right now just because things are shifting and so I didn't know where to go. And so we had to drive from San Diego to LA in from La we were all going to fly home and then I asked my travel agent, you know, maybe there would be a good place to go. And in fact, I also asked David Banner where his favorite places to go on the west coast where and he had some ideas like Big Sur and going up the west coast and then my travel agent said, what about the Malibu Beach in and for me Allah always held a connotation of work. You get in you get out like it's not my place that I want to hang out. I don't love it there. And so I didn't know that Malibu was different than La I had no idea to me. It's all work. But in 2019 every time I went to LA like I went to do a pre album release thing at Stevie Wonder's radio station, which I'm going to get back to the Stevie Wonder conversation in a minute. I did a pre album release thing and with him and in January I did some other stuff in LA in February and every time I did it I stayed by the beach I stayed in Santa Monica or Venice. And so when she said, how about Malibu I also did a private party. I forgot about that probably in August something like that and it was in Malibu and you know, it was beautiful was it house right? We're right on the beach like the beach went under the balcony at this house. And so a my travel agent said what about Malibu? I thought can't hurt and so I stayed at the Malibu Beach in for my birthday and I loved it the hotel rooms there look like a movie. They're perfectly modern. The floors are wood. The ceilings are vaulted and all the rooms and is a small boutique hotel, which I love and all the rooms are right on the beach. So you hear that white noise of the beach all day and I love white noise because I hear music in my head a lot. I deal with a lot of sound and so that sound that's not exactly music because music makes me think and feel it's so perfect for me. And there was Beach are you know Ocean Breeze blowing and it was sunny and some days it was cloudy and one day it rained and it was my birthday. So I felt alive and my favorite restaurant Nobu was less than a five minute walk from the hotel. So I'm birthday in hard. And I also tell myself since I'm in a la I'm going to go see Stevie Wonder. He calls me every year without fail for my birthday, which I count a huge blessing because who can say that and not only that who can say that Stevie Wonder calls them on their every birthday, but who can say that their hero calls them every year on their birthday and he called me and I you know, actually I saw him two days before my birthday and I told him I was in LA and I wanted to come Is it and I went to visit and we sat he was playing his harp a g and we sat in his living room area and just talked about stuff and he said some of the really most beautiful things to me and one of the things he said was that I was one of his favorite songwriters of my generation. He said because I sing about the vision of love that he believes in and I also learned that day that his niece Nicky who was I'm staying with him a lot. We all have heard that he's having a Health crisis with his kidneys. And so Nikki was there with him going through everything all the doctors appointments and stuff and Stevie Wonder is her favorite music, but her second favorite music is mine. And so she would play it for her grandchildren. And for Stevie's children. And she said that she would play that that playlist every day. And I said so you're saying that Stevie would hear my music at his doctors appointments, you know, like several times a week and she said and I said, what does he do when he hears a song? She said he just be rocking back and forth, you know, like patting his hand on the table and so I could almost cry right now thinking about the fact that my hero in his Health crisis would hear my music every day. Like I just was one of my greatest gifts I think to be able to gift someone who's given me so much. And so I said all that to say that I think the reason why he said that is because during this process he heard or more closely heard a lot of the songs of mine that he didn't really really know and That touches my soul and my spirit he's giving me love. So steady, so when he said that it made me feel. Seeing and loved and accomplished and so going back to the beginning of this segment when I said to myself, I didn't know if I was going to tour anymore is because if is because the Chase and I say that in that viral video the music industry is a Chase. It's par for the course that somebody's dangling that the industry itself this entity. This industry is dangling a carrot and you're chasing it and very few of us. Get to be the number one artist like right now. Is always the artist of the year on cover of Time Magazine only one person gets that you know, I didn't get stuff like that. I was beloved. I had big albums. There's a time when I was a big artist really big like one of the culture defining artists for a short time, but I wasn't number one, you know, like number one. And so I got tired of chasing that carrot and in the midst of all that of being sued many times and being betrayed many Times and being not taken care of. Like I had just come off that tour. I wasn't taking care of properly. I was just tired and when he said that it started making me think about the difference between rewards and awards because one of the things that I continue to chase are the awards that's a whole nother conversation. I might get into that in this next segment. But before I get into that I want to say that having my hero in the type of Singer/songwriter that comes along once and my friend say to me that I'm one of the his favorite songwriters and I'm one of the best of my generation is a reward that I could have never imagined. I wanted it wasn't it's not even a carrot because you I would never imagine that that's something I could experience. You know, and now that I'm thinking about it, I see rewards more as experiences and awards more as things you gain acquirements. Rewards our experiences and awards are acquire acquiring requirements. Let me try that one more time rewards our experiences and awards are requirements. I think I believe that I believe that this day December 11 2019. I believe that this day and I've had some beautiful beautiful experiences, but there are so much that I wanted to acquire. Fire and gain that I didn't and a lot of that has to do with Awards awards shows literally little shiny statues recognitions. A lot of that has eluded me. I was never like on the cover of People magazine or people's most beautiful people or Vanity Fair music issue or Rolling Stone or Vibe or none of that. I had a couple of covers a few but not many and none of the much much sought after. After one's so matter of fact, let's get into that in this next segment because I might be ready to make this announcement about what I want to do next with my career in this next segment. Let's get into it. Oh, but before we get into that, let me stay Malibu, California. Was a wonderful experience. I stayed at the Malibu Beach in for five days. And then I rented a house where my best friend who came to California from Memphis for just 36 hours just to see me my stylist Jolene one of my oldest friends a singer named Lauren a you can look her up. You might remember her and one of my good friends dog Mar and then we had some good male energy my friend knowledge Bennett and also my friends Creamed out who ended up doing some private Chef work for us. We spent some days there at the beach house. The guys didn't stay but they were there on occasion and the girls we all hung out at the beach with loud music playing and beautiful living room and eating food and talking and watching movies and having fun. I had the best birthday. It was a wonderful healing after that horrible experience of that, too. Or and then you know after my birthday ended I came home for one day and went back out to finish my tour. I did two dates in Maryland and I did one date in New York, which is a private show for the Red Cross and then I came home October 17th, and I rested until November 17th where I did the 16th 17th and 18th were Two shows in Nashville, Tennessee with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, then after that I decided to end my year. I was supposed to have a show yesterday December 10th and today December 11th in San Francisco to Symphony shows, but I had to pull out of the shows because I needed to take care of my health dental work some extensive dental work was a part of it and some other things that I choose not to go into here. More things but I really needed to take care of my health. And so I woke up today actually was at the dentist yesterday. So I woke up today knowing I wasn't going to go out and then I was going to just take time to heal and be quiet and I decided to do this podcast and so from September 15th to today December 11th that has been my journey and let's get into this next segment about my future Journey. So, let me see how I say this. Have made some decisions because I came into this year making a pact with myself that I was going to go hard as I could and make decision about how that felt later and as hard as I could means it refers to how I choose to write out my album cycle. So I album cycle is the time that you spend from the time that the album is released to the time that album is no longer being actively worked. To buy the label at radio and at retail. and I'm still kind of in album cycle but album cycle generally lasts about a year and going really hard with that meant doing as many interviews as I could and it meant touring and as I've mentioned several times in this podcast already. I went on tour twice this year the second time I went because I had committed to it even though I had a feeling that it was going to be very difficult because I had was already at my limit with all of it from the from the spring tour. But I had no idea was going to be as difficult as it was but I went because I was committed to doing this year full outgoing hard during this album cycle. And now that I've been through the full album cycle. There are certain patterns that continue to come up throughout my career of like having non supportive management or management that doesn't support me in the appropriate ways or you know struggling with touring not being paid guarantees that I feel are big enough for the production. I bring in for the artist that I am. All that stuff came up again this year and I work through it. I pushed through it and I realized that I'm tired of pushing through. Things need to change and and the thing that really needs to change his me and so I'm restructuring my business and I want to just handle it a different way. And so I'm working on that. I went back to Malibu to see Stevie but also to spend a certain time of year, which for me like is always right around Thanksgiving is a time of year when I feel like I'm starting fresh. It's my own personal. Nanu year of sorts and I went back to Malibu because I wanted to be by the beach in Malibu is a new discovery for me. So I went back in late. I'm sorry. What about in late November and I stayed in to early December and while I was there I spent time really thinking about how I want to restructure things. So I want to restructure the way my business is handled that whole art is peridot artist manager Paradigm thing. I am ready to be done with that. But also I started thinking about what else needs to be. Let go of what else needs to be replaced. And that is that dangling carrot. So let's get into that for a second. The awards and the rewards so this trip back to Malibu was precipitated by the Grammy nominations for the nominations came out. It was a couple days after these Nashville Symphony shows and I didn't even know they were coming out because I kind of tuned out from all that now and the reason why I tune out from all of it is because I have a traumatic relationship with the Grammys. Here's why in 2001. My first album came out February 2002 I go to the Grammys for the first time. I'm nominated for seven Grammys. I leave the award ceremony that night over 7 and the next year I go back. None of the black categories are televised none. No black categories. The only black artists that walked across that stage and performance that night were the roots and they were playing behind. Mmm. And so since none of the black categories were aired. Want to Grammys at night, but most people didn't know because it wasn't televised. So it was all anticlimactic because the first year when I didn't win everybody was talking about it the next year I went to nobody knows and it continues to be this ongoing political relationship with the Grammys over the years. I've since learned a lot of different things about politics. There's a thing called a voting Bloc how people can get their artists in and you know how it's all political because we as artists want to believe that the Grammys are the night when it's about the music. Like some of the other shows are about chart positions like you watch the American Music Awards, you know who's going to win? Because the winner is always the one who is highest on the Billboard Chart. It's how this show is structured. The Grammys is supposed to be about the music and things can be different and we can have see surprises and stuff like that. But there is a very very political element and I got caught up in someone else's political thing. And so a lot of the awards that could have been mine were denied me because of politics On the like the executive level Politics on the level of the executives. And so the head of my company could our massenburg was never going to out politicize Clive Davis who was the head of the dominant artist that years company Clive Davis always wins. And so having that experience every time the Grammys will come around I would get triggered. And not only triggered but I would continue to have weird experiences to like having an acoustic song that's nominated for best R&B song which made me feel like it felt kind of racist like because I'm a black artist got to be an R&B song. There's nothing in here but vocal and guitar. I love the idea that I was nominated for best R&B song I didn't win but can I get into what about a folk category or singer-songwriters something else? I don't know but you know that stuff that was you know, placement blatantly political and racist and sexist. All that stuff always came ahead to ahead for me every year around the Grammys. There's even a year speaking of Stevie Wonder that I was nominated with him for a song that he let me write the lyrics to he had a song called. He had a whole album his first album in 10 years is called a time to love and the title track. He had a concept for the for the song. He told me this story and I took it home and I wrote the lyrics and the song was nominated we In but even that year like the Grammys wouldn't even give me a televised seat. And then Stevie Wonder came out. He opened the show that year with someone else and I'm sitting in this untelevised seat while he's up there on stage and we're nominated like just all the stuff. It was always hurtful and I think of course that that trigger was planted inside of me from that first year. So even stuff that may not have hurt that bad hurt. You know, it was always something. So this year the nominations come out and I'm at home in Atlanta because I had to go visit my mother and I wake up at my brother's house because my niece Harper cried when I told her I was not going to spend the night. And so I went and spent the night. I literally slept in her bed and then that morning I woke up to find out that I was nominated for a Grammy and the nomination was for the song steady love which I thought was cool. I wasn't super excited because I don't get excited over the nominations anymore. We'll get into that in a second too, but I wasn't super excited because no more nominations came in and it wasn't that I thought I needed to be nominated for a kajillion of them because I'm not you know, I'm not a I'm not one of those artists who are like at the Forefront of being nominations and radio airplane stuff at this time in my career. So other people are in those categories and that's fine with me. I was disappointed because the album worthy was not nominated for something I didn't like That at all and there are different a few different categories that the album could have been nominated in and it was in none of them the album itself and I don't like that at all and it then flipped that trigger that I have inside of me of just feeling like I was never properly treated by the Grammys. Okay, and so I was dealing with that but alone for awhile week or two. I wouldn't tell anybody how I felt and then it started to Bubble over and then I started to feel Any and then I made a trip a plan for a trip to Seattle to visit my 94 year old friend get to the airport. I don't have my wallet. I missed my plane and I realized I'm running away I get back home and I am all dressed up with nowhere to go at seven o'clock in the morning and I realized I was going to Seattle because I was running away because I wanted to go somewhere and be by the water to work through my feelings. And then I realize I don't need to work through my feelings. What I need to do is give myself permission to feel what I feel and so having this conversation right now is important for me because all of my career everyone literally every single person around me told me not to say anything about how I felt at the Grammys because it would make me look spoiled and like sour grapes but what I want everyone listening to know is that the music industry truly is blatantly outwardly racist and sexist and political and so being a black woman in this world has this attacks the same way that being a black woman in the Larger world or in Corporate America or in any section of America has that black tax is always there and then there's that black woman tax. It's always there. I've had to deal with it. I learned about it through being in the music industry. My first album came out when I was 25. I knew about racism as a whole but I didn't know anything about the nuances of the black axe in the black female tax. I don't know if anybody ever says black female tax. I do because I know about the nuances of it now and what it feels like and so my conversation about the Grammys comes from that place not just from being spoiled because I didn't win I win I do want to win I would love to but the way that I've been treated by the industry. I am tired of being quiet about it. It hasn't been an easy Journey at all. And when I came into it, I was naive enough to think that most people were good. And it's not that I don't think most people are good. But what I do think is that a lot more people than I ever believed wanted to believe have biases against people based on race and gender. I wish it were not so but It is so and it's been hurtful and going back to that Toni Morrison documentary. When you see it, you will see the struggle of a black woman in a white male dominated world who is excellent at her craft and has to fight and has to be literally a history-making historically excellent writer to get what she got and that's after Decades of being a book editor. She Toni Morrison didn't quit her day job until she wrote Song of Solomon. That wasn't her third history-making book. And that's what triggered me that day. It was like well how fucking hard do we have to work to get the same thing that other artists get just by doing their work? It's a lot easier for white artists in this industry. And in this world. It's a lot easier for white female artist in this industry. And in this world. It's like easier for a white Executives and it's a lot easier for black artists who are more accepted by the white mainstream in this world. And so all of that is what I feel when the Grammys come around and so when I went to Malibu the second time this year I didn't go because I was trying to escape my feelings I went because I wanted to give myself room to work through my feelings and to make some decisions about this next decade because this is not just this is as we're all realizing. This is the end of a decade and In 2009. I made some decisions about my career that I have lived out and I would say those decisions have been successful. I remember being 34 years old and saying ten years from now. I will not be able to blame any of those people who are hurting me or who are stifling me for anything. I need to know that I made the decisions for myself. That's exactly what I did this last 10 years. And I said earlier in this podcast. I live a life. That's very Free By Design. I took my freedom and so I am very freeing. I flew to Malibu with my freedom and when I got there, I went there to talk with myself about what I want to do in this next decade, but it's not just the beginning of another decade. This is also the end of the first 20 years of my music career. And so let's get deeper in to my revelations in Malibu in this next segment. And so going back to the carrot. I decided in Malibu that I wasn't going to chase the carrot anymore. I want to be able to do my creative projects and I want them to be heard and seen but I'm not trying to win. I'm not trying to be number one. I'm not trying to beat anybody. I'm not trying to be the hottest shit out there. I'm not none of that. What I want is to do what I love and to be seen for it and to not be held down by anyone. That's what I want. The first of all, I don't want to hold myself down and so going back to this conversation about the trigger that's inside of me. I pray a very simple prayer for God to just take the trigger away. And so by the time I left Malibu, I was on my balcony smiling when I forgot this part a big part of the reason why I chose Malibu's because I saw that it was going to have like a lot of rain, you know, it never rains in southern California, but I saw there was going to be a lot of rain and I thought to myself rain at the beach sign me up. I love Ryan. I love cloudy days. I love all the negative ions of rain and the beach. I love all of it. So I saw that that was going to be happening out there in Malibu and I went and it gave me a lot of time to really feel good and to ponder these things and I prayed a simple prayer that God would just take the trigger away. And so by the time I left Malibu the last day it was sunny. I stood on my balcony. I thought to myself I also I did a lot of meditating. There's a meditation studio in Malibu called The Mind re which is the name they made up kind of like laundromat, but it's called the mind re-and. I did a lot of meditation classes where I was able to deepen my meditation practice and in the process of deepening my meditation practice, I was able to get out of my mind and too. I have moments of clarity that just that flash in and in those meditations I kept seeing do what you want to do. What do you want to do? And that's an interesting question for me to ask myself because I always have a goal in mind this time. I had to remind myself that all those thoughts that will come up like I would love to do this or I should do that. I want to try this or what I really want to do in 2020. I had to remind myself that those thoughts are the things I want and so I stood on my back. See the last day before I left Malibu and what I felt was Joy about the Grammy nomination for steady love and I had to remember how bad it really can be because when I put out the album song for seishin, I didn't get any nominations. And for those of you who are my soul bird family, you know that the song I Am light is important to me and has gone on to be important to a lot of Well, and I released it twice I talked about it in this podcast series. You hear me talk about it in the song for station. I am light but I released that song twice because I feel like the first time it wasn't heard. And so the second time I released the song I am like I got nominated for a Grammy for Best New Age album and I was able to sing that song at the grammy pre-show and that was huge because I know how bad it can get like sometimes. The Grammys can just ignore me all together. And so I had to remember that like could be so much worse. And so steady love was nominated for a Grammy and you know, like that's hot. And had to let go of the disappointment of worthy not being nominated because it's just what it is is where I'm at this time and I also had to remember that it's other people's chance other people are in those categories and I'm not saying I should take anyone's Place. Everybody has their time in the is different. You know, what's people's time for different things at different times. And so even though I wasn't winning there was a couple of years where I my name dominated the Grammy ceremonies, even though it was because I lost it. Still I was a dominant name and so I had to remember all of that and I left Malibu celebrating everything that I had accomplished in 2019 celebrating the clarity about what I want to do in 2020, but especially celebrating the clarity about what I wanted for from 2020 to 2030. And realizing that I'll be in my mid-50s in 10 years. And what is it that I want to create and realizing again? Like I said to myself in 2009. I can't blame anybody else. And so my best friend who have mentioned three times now in this episode. She said, you know gratitude is important and when she said it to me before I went out to Malibu and I'm like, okay. Okay gratitude. Yeah tell me something that works. But what I know when I'm calm and what I got out of my meditations was that It really does pay to be to look around at what you have to be grateful for and then also to ask yourself. What is the narrative when you feel you can't find gratitude in something and so here's what I realized that my narrative around not being nominated for worthy was here these assholes go again. They're going to ignore me again. It's going to be a crazy, you know heartbreaking experience again with the Grammys and and how dare they What I had to realize is that number one steady love is something to be grateful for number two. I have no control over that number three. I'm a black woman in America. There's certain things that come along with it in the politics and all that. Yes, but also being a black woman in America has been the biggest part of what's allowed me to make the music that's made the impact that it's made the song. I am not my hair came out of who I am all my songs come out of who I am and I've been able to reach people just like me other black women who struggle with a lot of the same things I struggle with but also I've been able to reach other people inside of their struggles whatever they are because of my own struggles. And so I had to remember that that I have Everything to be grateful for for being a black woman. I love being a black woman even when it's hard and I had to remember that and so that opened a Floodgate of gratitude. And then also Awards and rewards to have Stevie Wonder say he thinks I'm great at what I do. I'm a great songwriter reward to know that there are thousands of people women and men across this world who are enlightened and uplifted or fortified or could use my music. The tool all the people who walk down the aisle and did their first dance to study love this year all the women who did their big chop to I'm not my hair cancer patients and women. We just wanted to go natural. I heard people walking down the aisle to he heals me people in church, then he heals me the song there is hope being part of the Obama first Obama Campaign, like video people still talk about video and how it's helped them to understand their Womanhood heart of the matter being part of the big Sex and the City movie. He liked all the rewards I've had. I have so much to be grateful for and I left Malibu realizing that and that the other Wards. I have a few of those two because I have four Grammys and I have NAACP image Awards one that I won with Stevie Wonder. I want a Grammy with Herbie Hancock. I have I think three BET Awards have a nice amount of awards to and even though I've been overlooked more times than I've been seen. Is my first time really realizing what it means that when people say well being nominated is its own gift and I understand now that it is because it means that you're in the game and your scene and so I left Malibu with gratitude for my rewards and my Awards and that cleared up space in my mind to look at this next decade because the carrot I realized I can stop chasing. Here right now and I decided to just stop I'm done. And once I said that there were a lot of other things that just went away inside of me a lot of anxieties and a lot of things that I would be doing even right now December 11th places. I would be and things I'd be doing I'm not doing it because I want to put my energy in other places and then once I got home, I was in my meditation space. And I realized that there's a carrot that I was dangling in front of myself. So I'm going to make this a two-part episode because I want to talk more about this carrot what it was called. Yes. It had a name. I have an announcement. I want to make this very important to me. I have a profession. I want to make that is very important to me. And of course we're going to have our closing affirmation and final goodbyes. So join me here for part 2 of song recession steady love. All right. See you there.  0.850580        65227       SongVersation                                   I am India.Arie / India Arie and SongVersation is a podcast where I choose one of my songs, we listen to it, and I riff on it!

We move through our lives day after day living through the same repetitive Cycles in the same stressful patterns that often leave us feeling defeated underappreciated or unfulfilled. But what if there were different way to perceive life what if out there we were able to find the keys to a happy healthy and fulfilling reality right here right now for those of us who are looking for a way to transform our lives for those of us who want to learn how to fully live in this moment to change how we feel how we perceive the world and awaken to a better reality so we can fully live this life. This is the This Life podcast I'm your host heat Cummings. I'm here to inspire you to ask yourself the question. Are you living or are you killing time? What's up everyone and welcome to another episode of the Live This Life podcast. This is an episode that I've been very much looking forward to we're going to jump into the Power of Now chapter 1 And very much looking forward to this one in the last episode that we did on the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle a we just did the forward and introduction which I thought was really valuable to the rest of the content in the book. But now we get to jump into the the meat and potatoes of this this great book. I've really leaned on this one this week. I've read a few chapters that were pivotal to me that I've had bookmarked. It's been a tough week but managed to pull through this one. Oh, And before we get started on this episode, I wanted to take a minute and read the very first review that we've gotten for the Live This Life podcast. This one's through Apple podcasts. And if you are so inspired and you enjoy the podcast if you could go on there and give us a rating and comment, it would be awesome. It'd be nice to hear what people are actually thinking about it, whatever platform you're listening to I'm not familiar with many of the platforms out there other than Apple. That's the one I use to listen to my own. Podcasts of all the ones I like to listen to and use anchor to actually record this podcast. But this review came in through Apple. It was a five star review which said by gal girl 0-5 which said great blueprint for learning how to live your life to its fullest explorations of self-discovery self-awareness and ways to have a meaningful and fulfilling life. Thank you gal girl of five wherever you are. That was an awesome thing to discover. A and like I said, if you're inspired to leave a review, I will definitely review them on the podcast. I'll read them out loud. That's an awesome. Awesome thing that can motivate you to to keep it going. Now before we go on just a couple of really important fundamental things that this book mentions in its forward in the introduction a couple of very very profound things that resonated with me was about how the mind was like a butterfly Muttering from one flower to another and that the mining gauge is past experience or projecting its own made-for-television movie anticipating. What's to come? I for one found myself in that mode in a constant state of that mode my entire life before I found much of these Concepts and started meditation on my own and that Russell DeCarlo when he wrote this forward talks about how we rarely ever find ourselves resting in the oceanic depth of the You're in now which this book helps people find when you take these Concepts and embody them it helps you really embody. The now the moments of now that are in your life instead of thinking about the past or worrying about the future it gets you to be here now and that's where the Fulfillment in life really comes from and that's why I felt that reading the forward in the introduction was so important. The other part was when Eckhart was talking about when he had a profound moment of Awakening and he was in the room that he had been. In in a thousand times and he saw in a whole different way. It was like almost like seeing things in high definition. He saw a whole different room that he'd seen a thousand times, but he had seen it over and over again and I had kind of noticed that with experiences that I've had over and over different people have belt dealt with or places. I've been the Situation's were so much more in depth. They were so much more meaningful and I was able to kind of be there and appreciate them in the moment instead of Most having that rearview mirror nostalgic. Look at things like you just kind of go through certain things and then you look back on them and say oh, I wish I enjoyed that more when it was here since I've really embodied all this I've appreciated so many of just the little tiny moments like going apple picking with my family about how how many years we have left of doing that as a family with my kid being a small kid and little things like seeing them going to or seeing him going trick-or-treating and doing all that kind of stuff. This year. I just I really was able to be in those moments and enjoy every single bit of it. And I know that these Concepts revisiting this book after I've read a few years ago revisiting these things now in the podcast is really helped me sort of re Vigor ate a lot of the things I learned from this book. Now, there are certain portions of the book where Eckhart put in this little symbol indicating. He wanted the reader to pause and reflect for a moment. So when we get to Those portions in the book, I'll play a short little clip of Maybe five to ten seconds if you'd like to use that time to reflect then do so if you want to go back and listen to that portion over again before the reflection pause it and reflect longer whatever you choose to do. It's a good time to do it, but that's what he wanted done in the middle of that book. So I figured it was significant to interject that for a moment and let everybody pause to reflect without further Ado. Let's get it growing here and read chapter. One of the Power of Now You are not your mind the greatest obstacle to enlightenment. Enlightenment, what is that a bigger had been sitting by the side of a road for over 30 years one day a stranger walked by spare some change mumbled the beggar mechanically holding out his old baseball cap. I have nothing to give you said The Stranger. Then he asked what's that you're sitting on nothing replied the beggar just an old box. I've been sitting on it for as long as I can remember. Ever looked inside said the stranger. No, so the beggar, what's the point? There's nothing in there have a look inside insisted the stranger the beggar managed to pry open the lid with astonishment disbelief and Elation. He saw the box was filled with gold. I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside not inside any box as in the parable, but somewhere even closer inside yourself those who have not found. True wealth which is the radiant Joy of being in the Deep unshakable peace that comes with it are Beggars, even if they have great material wealth there looking outside for scraps of pleasure or fulfillment for validation security or love while they have a treasure within that not only includes all of those things but is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer. the word Enlightenment conjures up the idea of some superhuman accomplishment and the ego likes to keep it that way but it is simply your natural state of felt Oneness with being it is a state of connectedness with something immeasurable and indestructible something that almost paradoxically is essentially you and is yet much greater than you It is finding your true nature beyond the name and form the inability to feel this connectedness gives rise to the illusion of separation from yourself and from the world around you you then perceive yourself consciously or unconsciously as an isolated fragment fear arises in Conflict within and without becomes the norm. I love the Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as the end of suffering. There's nothing superhuman in that is there of course as a definition it is incomplete. It only tells you what enlightenment is not know suffering, but what's left when there is no more suffering. The Buddha is silent on that and is silence implies that you'll have to find out for yourself. He uses a negative definition so that the Mind cannot make it into Something to Believe In or into a superhuman accomplishment a goal that is impossible for you to attain despite this precaution the majority of Buddhists still believe that Enlightenment is for the Buddha not for them. At least not in this lifetime. You use the word being can you explain what you mean by that being is the Eternal ever-present one life beyond the Myriad of forms of life that are subject to birth and death. However being is not only Beyond but also deep within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible Essence. This means that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self your true nature. But doesn't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is still when you were present when your attention is fully and intensely in the now being can be felt but it can never be understood mentally to regain awareness of being and to abide in that state of feeling realization is enlightenment. And now there is the possible when you say being are you talking about God if you are then why don't you say it? The word God has become empty of meaning through thousands of years of misuse I use it sometimes but I do a sparingly by misuse. I mean that people who have never even glimpsed the realm of the Sacred the infinite vastness behind that word use it with great conviction as if they knew what they're talking about or they argue against it as if they knew what it is that they're denying. This misuse gives rise to observe observe beliefs assertions any Delusions such as my or our God is the only true God and your God is false or Nietzsche's which is Friedrich Nietzsche. Chh-chh Nicha. He's a German philosopher. Nietzsche is famous statement of God is dead. The word God has become a closed concept the moment. The word is uttered a mental images created no longer perhaps of an old man with a white beard, but still a mental representation of someone or Or something outside of you, and yes almost inevitably a male someone or something. Neither God nor being nor any other word can Define or explain the ineffable reality behind the word. So the only important question is whether the word is a help or a hindrance in enabling you to experience that toward which it points. Does it Point Beyond itself to a transcendental reality or does it lend itself to easily to become no more than an idea in your head that you believe in a mental Idol? The word being explained nothing nor does God being however has the advantage that it is only an open-concept. It does not reduce the infinite invisibility to a finite entity. It is impossible to form a mental image of it. Nobody can claim exclusive possession of being it is your very essence and it is immediately accessible to you as the feeling of your own presence the realization. I am that is prior to I am this or I am that so it is only a small step from the word being to the experience of being and when they keep putting being into this book. It's capitalized. So I guess being is to represent God. What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality? Identification with your mind which causes thought to become compulsive not to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful Affliction, but we don't realize this because almost everybody is suffering from it. So it is considered normal this incessant mental noise prevents you from finding the realm of inner Stillness that is inseparable from being. It also creates a false mind made self that casts a shadow of fear and suffering. We will look at it all in more detail. Later. The philosopher Descartes a believe that he had found the most fundamental truth when he made his famous statement. I think therefore I am he had in fact given expression to the most basic error to equate thinking with being in identity with thinking the compulsive thinker which means almost everyone lives in a state of apparent separateness and insanely complex world of continuous problems. conflict a world that reflects the ever increasing fragmentation of the mind and Layton is a state of wholeness of being at one and therefore at peace at one with life in its manifested aspect the world as well as with your deepest self and life unmanifested at one with being Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering and of continuous conflict within and without but also the end of the Dreadful enslavement to incessant thinking what an incredible Liberation this is identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of Concepts labels images words judgments and definitions that block all true relationship. It comes between you and yourself between you and your fellow man and woman between you and your nature between you and God. It is the screen of thought that creates the illusion of separateness. The illusion that there is a you and a totally separate other you then forget the essential fact that underneath the level of physical appearances in separate forms. You are one with all that is by forget. I mean that you can no longer feel this Oneness as self-evident reality. You may believe it to be true, but you no longer know it to be true. A belief may be comforting only through your own experience. However, does it become liberating? Thinking has become a disease disease happens when things get out of balance. For example, there is nothing wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in the body. But when this process continues in disregard of the total organism cells proliferate and we have disease the mind is superb instrument if used rightly if you was wrongly however, it becomes very destructive to put it more accurately. It is not so much that you use your mind wrongly. You usually don't use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease you believe that you are your mind. This is the delusion the instrument has taken you over. So in the book, there are these italicized portions that look like they're question-and-answer sort of things. This one is italicized this next paragraph. I don't quite agree. It is true that I do a lot of aimless thinking like most people but I can still choose to use my mind to get Accomplish things and I do that all the time and the response to that is just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an atom bomb doesn't mean that you use your mind just as dogs love to chew bones the Mind loves to get his teeth into problems. That's why does crossword puzzles and builds atom bombs. You have no interest in either. Let me ask you this. Can you be free of your mind whenever you want to have you found the off button and the question response to that is Is you need to stop thinking altogether? No, I can't except maybe for a moment or two. Then the mind is using you you are unconsciously identified with it. So you don't even know that you are it's slave. It's almost as if you were possessed without knowing it and so you take the possession the possessing entity to be yourself. The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity The Thinker Knowing this enables you to observe the entity the moment you start watching The Thinker a high level of Consciousness becomes activated. Then you begin to realize that there is a vast realm of intelligence Beyond thought that thought is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. You also realize that all the things that truly matter Beauty love creativity Joy inner peace arise from Beyond the mind you into awakened freeing yourself from your mind What exactly do you mean by watching The Thinker? When someone goes to the doctor and says I hear a voice in my head he or she will most likely be sent to a psychiatrist. The fact is that in a very similar way virtually everyone hears a voice or several voices in their head all the time the involuntary thought processes that you don't realize you have the power to stop continuous monologues or dialogues. You've probably come across mad people in the street incessantly talking or muttering to themselves. Well, that's not much different from what you and all the other normal people do except that you don't do it out loud. The voice comments speculates judges Compares complaints likes dislikes and so on the voice isn't necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time. It may be Reviving the recent or distant pass or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations here at often imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes. This is called worried. Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual images or mental movies. Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it would interpret it in terms of the past. This is because the voice belongs to your condition mind which is the result of all your past history as well as the collective cultural mindset you've inherited. So you see and judge the present Through The Eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person's Own Worst Enemy many people live with a Tormentor in their head that continuously attacks and punishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause of the untold misery and unhappiness as well as of disease. It is the cause of Untold misery and happened. Penis as well as of disease. The good news is you can free yourself from your mind. This is the only true Liberation you can take the first step right now start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can pay particular attention to any repetitive thought patterns. Those old gramophone records that have been playing in your head perhaps for many years. This is what I mean by watching The Thinker which is another way of saying listen to The Voice in your head be there as the witnessing presence when you listen to that voice listen to it impartially. That is to say do not judge do not judge or condemn what you here for doing so would mean that the same voice has come in again through the back door. You'll soon realize there is the voice in here. I am listening to it watching it this I am realization. The sense of your own presence is not a thought. It arises from Beyond the mind. So when you listen to a thought you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of Consciousness is come in as you listen to the thought you feel a conscious presence your Deeper Self behind or underneath the thought as it were. The thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides because you are no longer energizing the mind to identification with it. This is the beginning of the end of involuntary in compulsive thinking when a thought subsides you experience a discontinuity in the mental stream a gap of no mind at first the gaps will be short a few seconds perhaps but gradually they will become longer. when these gaps occur, you feel a certain Stillness and peace inside you this is the beginning of your natural state of felt Oneness with being Which is usually obscured by the mind with practice the sense of Stillness and peace will deepen. In fact, there is no end to its depth. You also feel a subtle emanation of Joy arising from deep within the joy of being. It is not. It is not a trance-like state. Not at all. There's no loss of consciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the price of Peace were a lowering of your Consciousness and the price of Stillness a lack of Vitality in alertness, then they would not be worth having in this state of interconnectedness. You are much more alert more awake than in the mind identified State you are fully present. It also raises the Operational frequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body as you go more deeply into this realm of no mind as it is sometimes called in the East you realize that the state of pure Consciousness in that state you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking all emotions your physical body as well as the whole external World become relatively insignificant in comparison to it and yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as yourself that presence is essentially you in at the same time inconceivably greater than you. What I'm trying to convey here may sound paradoxical or even contradictory, but there is no other way that I can express it. Instead of quote watching The Thinker you can also create a gap in the mindstream simply by directing the focus of your intention into the now just become more intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do in this way. You draw Consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of Mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking this is the essence of meditation. In your everyday life you can practice this by taking any routine activity that normally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest attention so that it becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the stairs in your house or place of work pay close attention to every step every movement. Even your breathing be totally present or when you wash your hands pay attention to all the sense perceptions of All ciated with the activity the sound and feel of the water the movement of your hands the scent of the soap and so on or when you get into your car after you close the door pause for a few seconds and observe the flow of your breath become aware of a silent, but powerful sense of presence. There is one certain Criterion by which you can measure your success in this practice the degree of peace that you feel within so the single most vital step on your journey toward Enlightenment is this learn to disidentify? five from your mind every time you create a gap in the Stream of the Mind the light of your Consciousness grows stronger one day, you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as you sense as your sense of self does not depend on it Enlightenment Rising above thought. The question and italics is isn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world. Your mind is an instrument a tool it is there to be used for a specific task. And when the task is completed you lay down as it is I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature much of it is also harmful observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy. This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction what characterizes an addiction quite simply this you no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you it also gives you a false sense of pleasure pleasure that invariably turns into pain. Why should we be addicted to thinking? Because you were identified with it, which means that you derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your mind because you believe that you would cease to be if you stop thinking as you grow up you form a mental image of who you are based on the personal and cultural conditioning. We may call this Phantom self the ego it consists of Mind activity and can only be kept going through constant thinking the term ego means different things to different people. But when I use it here, it means a false self created by unconscious identification with the mind. To the ego the present moment hardly exists only past and future are considered important this total reversal of the truth accounts for the fact that in the ego mode. The mind is so dysfunctional. It is always concerned with keeping the past alive because without it, who are you it constantly projects itself into the future to ensure its continued survival and to seek some kind of release or fulfillment there. It says one day when this that or the other happens, I'm going to be okay happy at peace. Even when the ego seems to be concerned with the present. It is not the present that it sees it misinterprets it completely because it looks at it through the eyes of the past or it reduces the present to a means to an end and end that always lies in the mind projected future. Observe your mind and you'll see that this is how it works the present moment holds the key to Liberation, but you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind. The question italics is I don't want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn't mind learning to think more clearly in a more focused way, but I don't want to lose my mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thing we have without it. We would just be another species of animal the predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of Consciousness. We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency. Otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind. Which has grown into a monster? I will talk about this more in detail. Later. Thinking and Consciousness are not synonyms or not synonymous. Thinking is only a small aspect of Consciousness thought cannot exist without Consciousness, but Consciousness does not need thought Enlightenment means Rising above thought not falling back to a level below thought the level of an animal or plant. In the enlightened State you still use your thinking mind when needed but in a much more focused and effective way than before you use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary internal dialogue and there is an inner Stillness. When you do use your mind and particularly when you when a creative solution is needed you oscillate every few minutes or so between thought and Stillness between mind and no mind. No mind is a Consciousness without thought only in that way. Is it possible to think creatively because only in that way does thought have any real power thought alone when it is no longer connected with the much vaster Realm Of Consciousness quickly becomes Barren insane. If the mind is essentially a survival machine attack and defense against other Minds Gathering storing and analyzing information. This is what is it is good at but it is not at all creative. All true artists whether they know it or not create from a place of no mind from inner Stillness the mind then gives form to the creative impulse or Insight even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude the surprising result of a nationwide inquiry mm of among America's most eminent mathematicians including Einstein to find out there working methods. Was that thinking Quote plays only a subordinate part in the brief decisive phase of the creative act itself. So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don't know how to think but because they don't know how to stop thinking. It wasn't through the Mind through thinking that the miracle that is life on Earth or your body were created and are being sustained. There is clearly an intelligence at work. That is far greater than the mind. How can a single human cell measuring one one thousandth of an inch across contain instructions within his DNA that would fill 1,000 books of 600 pages each. The more we learn about the workings of the body the more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work within it and how little we know. When the mind reconnects with that it becomes a most wonderful tool it then serves something greater than itself. Emotion the body's reaction to your mind. And italics the question is what about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more than I do in my mind. Mind in the way I use the word is not just thought it includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental emotional reactive patterns emotion arises at the place where your mind and body meet. It is the body's reaction to your mind or you might say a reflection of your mind in the body. For example, an attack thought or hostile thought will create a buildup of energy in the body that we call anger. The body is Be ready to fight the thought that you were being threatened physically or psychologically causes the body to contract and this is the physical side of what we call fear research has shown that strong emotions even cause changes in the biochemistry of the body the biochemical changes represent the physical or material aspect of the emotion. Of course, you are not usually conscious of all your thought patterns and it is often only through watching your emotions that you can bring them into awareness. The more you are identified with your thinking your likes dislikes judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you are as the watching Consciousness the stronger the emotional energy charge will be whether you are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your emotions, if you are cut off from them, you will eventually experience them on a purely physical level as a physical problem or symptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent years. So we don't need to go into it here a strong unconscious emotional pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to just happen to you. For example, I've observed that people who carry a lot of anger inside without being aware of it and without expressing it are more likely to be attacked verbally or even physically by other angry people and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong emanation of angry that certain people pick up subliminally and that triggers their only in anger. If you have difficulty feeling your emotions start focusing attention on the inner energy field of your body feel the body from within this will also put you in touch with your emotions will explore this in more detail. Later. This is in italics. You say that an emotion is in the mines reflection in the body. But sometimes there is a conflict between the two the mind says no while the emotion says yes or the other way around. If you really want to know your mind, the body will always give you a truthful reflection. So look at the emotion or rather feel it in your body. If there is an apparent conflict between them the thought will be the LI the emotion will be the truth. Not the ultimate truth of who you are, but the relative truth of your state of mind at the time. Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental processes is certainly common. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity into awareness as thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as an emotion in of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought which I described earlier. The only difference is that while a thought is in your head and emotion has a strong physical component. So it is primarily felt in the body. You can then allow the emotion to be there without being controlled by it you no longer are the emotion you're the Watcher the observing presence. If you practice this all that is unconscious in you will be brought into the light of Consciousness and italics is says so observing our emotions is as in is as important as observing our thoughts. Yes, make it a habit to ask yourself. What is going on inside of me at this moment. The question will point you in the right direction, but don't analyze just watch Focus your attention within feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no emotion present take your attention more deeply into the inner energy field of your body. It is the doorway into being An emotion usually represents an amplified and energized thought pattern and because of its often overpowering energetic charged. It is not easy initially to stay present enough to be able to watch it. It wants to take you over and it usually succeeds unless there is enough presence within you. If you're pulled into unconscious identification with the emotion through lack of presence, which is normal the emotion temporarily becomes you often a vicious cycle builds up between your thinking and the emotion they often feed each other a thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the form of an emotion in the vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern. By dwelling mentally on the situation event or person that is the perceived cause of the emotion the thought feeds the energy to the emotion which in turn energizes the thought pattern and so on basically all emotions are modifications of one primordial. Undifferentiated emotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are Beyond name and form because of its undifferentiated nature. It is hard to find a name that precisely describes this emotion fear comes close but apart from a continuous sense of threat. It also includes a deep sense of Abandonment in incompleteness. It may be best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as the basic emotion is simply called. Pain, one of the main tasks of the mind is to fight remove that emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but it can never achieve but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact the heart of the mine struggles to get rid of the pain the greater the pain the mind can never find solution nor can allow now nor can it afford to allow you to find the solution because it is it Itself an intrinsic part of the problem imagine a chief of police trying to find an arsonist when the arsonist is the chief of police. You will not be free of that pain until you cease to derive your sense of self from identification with the mind which is to say from ego. The mind is then toppled from its place of power and being reveals itself as your true nature. Yes. I know what you're going to ask in italics. It says I was going to ask what about positive emotions such as love and joy. They are inseparable from your natural state of interconnectedness with being. Glimpses of love and joy or brief moments of deep peace are possible whenever a gap occurs in the stream of thought for most people such gaps happen rarely and only accidentally in the moments when the mind is rendered speechless, sometimes triggered by great Beauty extreme physical exertion or even great danger suddenly. There is an inner Stillness and within that Stillness, there's a subtle but intense Joy, there's love there's Usually such moments are short-lived as the Mind quickly resumes its noise making activity that we call thinking love joy and peace cannot flourish until you freed yourself from mind dominance, but they are not what I would call emotions. They lie beyond the emotions on a much deeper level. So you need to become fully conscious of your emotions and be able to feel them before you can feel that which lies Beyond them emotion literally means disturbance the word comes from the And Amor ver meaning to disturb. Love joy and peace are deep states of being rather than three aspects of the state of interconnectedness with being. As such they have no opposite this is because they arise from Beyond the Mind emotions on the other hand being part of the dualistic mind are subject to the law of opposites. This simply means that you cannot have good without bad. So in the enlightened mind identified condition, what is sometimes wrongly called Joy is the usually short-lived pleasure side of the continuously alternating pain pleasure cycle. Pleasure is always derived from something outside. You wear as Joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow or it will leave you so its absence will give you pain and what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging an extremely needy condition that can turn into the opposite at the flick of a switch many quote love relationships after the initial Euphoria has passed actually oscillate Between Love and Hate attraction and attack. Real love doesn't make you suffer. How could it it doesn't suddenly turn into hate nor does real joy into pain. As I said, even before you were enlightened before you have freed yourself from your mind. You may get glimpses of true Joy true love or of a deep inner peace still but vibrantly alive. These are aspects of your true nature, which is usually obscured by the mind. Even within a normal addictive relationship there can be moments when presence of something more genuine something more Incorruptible can be felt but they will only be glimpses soon to be covered up again through mind interference. It may then seem that you have something very precious and lost it. For your mind May convince you that it was an illusion. Anyway, the truth is that it wasn't an illusion. You cannot lose it. It is a part of your natural state which can be obscured but never by can never be destroyed by the mind, even when the sky is heavily overcast. The son doesn't disappear. It's still there on the other side of the clouds and italics. It says the Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desire or craving and that to be free of pain. We need to cut the bonds of Desire. All Cravings are the Mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in external things in the future as a substitute for the joy of being as long as I'm in my mind. I am those Cravings those needs wants attachments and aversions and part and apart from them. There is no I accept as a mere possibility an unfulfilled potential a seed that has not yet sprouted. And that stay even my desire to become free or enlightened is just another craving for fulfillment or completion in the future. So don't seek to become free of Desire or achieve enlightenment. Become present be there is the Observer of the Mind instead of quoting the Buddha be the Buddha be the awakened one, which is what the word Buddha means humans have been in the grip of pain for eons ever since they fell from the State of Grace entered the realm of time and mind and lost awareness of being at that point. They started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments in an alien Universe unconnected to the source into each other. Pain is as inevitable pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is a as long as you are unconscious spiritually speaking. I'm talking here primarily of emotional pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease resentment hatred self-pity guilt anger depression jealousy and so on even the slightest irritation are all forms of pain and every pleasure or emotional High contains within itself the seed of pain it's Inseparable opposite which will manifest in time anybody who has ever taken drugs to get high will know that the Eventually turns into a law that the pleasure turns into some form of pain many people also know from their own experience how easily and quickly and intimate relationship can turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain seen from a higher perspective of both the negative and positive polarities are faces of the same coin. Are both part of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the Mind identified it going State of Consciousness. There are two levels to your pain the pain that you create now and the pain from the past that still lives on in your mind and body ceasing to create pain in the present and dissolving past pain. This is what I want to talk about now. And that wraps up the first chapter of The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and this has a great a great series of quotes and Concepts where we really dive into what the mind is actually doing behind the scenes before you kind of get into that perspective of The Watcher and in the first episode of the podcast. I talked about that concept of You know when you realize that you're not just a character in the book, you're the you're the really can look at it from the perspective of the reader and then beyond that you can Elevate yourself to the level of the author. This is kind of a similar concept where you are the Watcher of your mind, you're the Watcher of your thoughts. Most of which were unconscious of I mean before I really got to a lot of these Concepts, you know, I was in my mid-30s and you have 30 something years there with that particular individual. I'm being myself. of thoughts running on autopilot all the conditionings everything else that has just created a knee-jerk response a conditioned response of the way that you react to stimulus the way that you react to things that happen in your life and people and you get triggered to react a certain way you do it the emotion comes out you say things you do things, but when you're able to step back and not have the same reactions and you're able to embody what they're talking about here about freeing yourself from your mind and becoming the Watcher you're watching what's going on in your own emotions. You're watching The Thinker freeze you in such a liberating way and when we get those pause points, I'm not sure how to react to those. I don't I'm debating not pausing at those points, but I mean that they're in here for a reason because that guard wanted the the person to sit and pause. Those certain points. So I mean, I guess for now it's a valuable thing to leave in there because it's a concept where he wanted you to pause and think about what it was and you know, this is the kind of episode where I would probably I probably will listen to this myself a few times to embody it all because there's so much content in here, but when you can really step back and look at the thoughts and look at your reactions, even if you have the Monday Morning Quarterback, you get In the Heat of the Moment with a certain situation and then once you're done you can step back and look at how you thought How you reacted most of us can't do that that observation In the Heat of the Moment. We can't do it in the middle of a certain situation. But after it's over you can look back and say, you know, I wish I would react in a different way you're doing that in essence and that's that's sort of conditioning. That's the walk the crawling before you walk and then the walk before you run. So if you're able to do that after certain certain situations and you can Monday Morning Quarterback your own reactions to things that's a start and then from there you can sort of observe your own emotions as Going through things and you'll have more experience in doing that as you embody these Concepts a little bit more want to thank you everybody for tuning in to this episode of the Live This Life podcast and the reading of the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle a provided by Namaste publishing will catch you next time keep living everybody. Thanks for listening.

Hello people who truly from the bottom of their hearts. Love Mitch McConnell, like you really love them and you love his chin. I just want to say that you're all welcome here regardless of your political beliefs. I feel like that doesn't get said enough and I would like to say it as a reminder, you know, we got to be connected somehow. We're all muscle and Bones Underneath It All Except if people are bones, but if you don't bones, you're on a person right is that rude? There's got to be some person with some disease who doesn't have bones and I'm to you I'm I'm hope you get better that probably doesn't get fixed, you know easily but we have to be connected. Somehow this Us Versus Them shit. It's what I like to call toxic Humanity. Oh, however, I will I must say I wish I said this on the first episode, but I was real nervous. I'm slowly getting less nervous as we progress if you've noticed thank you. But by listening to this podcast from here on out, okay, you're formally entering a binding verbal agreement that you will not do the following rape don't rape. You won't murder. Unless someone's trying to murder you in which case you gotta do what you gotta do and you won't push people down the stairs don't do that. Use your words. I'm going to be adding additional things to this list every so often. And but this is a legal binding verbal contract because I said it is so I'm so excited to have listeners who aren't rapists. Don't push people down stairs. Welcome everyone. Oh, I'm performing here. I'm performing in New York City. If your New York City tomorrow just in silver and I were friends and we're not having sex and I say that because we're starting a new monthly show called we're not banging despite what you hear on the Reddit threads. That's weird that people Talk about that on there because do something else but tomorrow Thursday October 24th 9 p.m. At the stand which is an incredible Comedy Club. Go check that out tickets are in the description of this podcast and Saturday November 16th in New York City. I co-host glamourpuss with Wendy Starling. Who's a great comedian. I don't know why I said it like that because I felt like it. Shut up San Diego California. I'm India, November 21st to the I wrote the 21st down here the 21st of the But also be there until the 23rd headlining American Comedy Company, that's pretty cool headlining solo.

We're not banging and Philadelphia my boo to15 my Eagles Eagles get a towel get a Huggy get a while ago to wall. I'll go down and get a hickey will also go to see be February 6th to the 8th at Helium Comedy Club. Did I do that? Right? I think I did. Yeah, February 6th to the 8th. I wanted to read an email that I got from to podcasts ago. It's in response to a random thought that I had about Airline employees Pilots Delta. Everybody works the airline having weird ass fucking long-ass pauses in the middle of their speeches and it's like sometimes I could see them and I'm like, what are you you're not really looking at porn? So this guy wrote me he's a pilot. So he would know some Insider tips that I wanted to share the subject of his email is why we pause when making announcements, I love this email out of all the vastly more important content you've talked about on the second episode. I can only speak to the announcements from the flight deck. There is usually a ton of shit going on in a short time. We have at the gate before we push back. I'm assuming this guy's a pilot. You might not be a pot either way you works for an heir. plain company use your words, Christina Preflighting the aircraft is usually the most pressured part of the trip when I make my announcements I try to get the pertinent info together before I start but it's all in different places and changes every flight. So when we pause it's probably because we either forgot to write down something or convert a temperature at the destination because everything we have is in Celsius which wine or we've said it three times before for different flights plus we have the gate agents giving us the Manifest the rampers calling in the bag counts over the radio and any number of other things that might be happening in the cabin on top of programming the flight computers this the announcement itself is pretty low on the priority list. All right, I get it. So what you hear is everything when we key the mic ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard flight in parentheses pregnant pause two for two the weather in Orlando is pregnant pause around 80 degrees. He's what we are really saying is ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard flight. Goddamn it with who are we this time? Oh, yeah, 2:42, the weather and Orlando is at 25 Celsius double it at 30 around 80 degrees and so on. I know the same goes for the flight attendants during boarding. They have the gate agents barking at them to get out on time. They sometimes have cleaners and Caterers still in their space along with any passenger issues. They can be in the middle of an announcement and a boarding passenger will ask them if they can have a water at their seats. Oh, yeah. Totally useless info, LOL more importantly good on you for kicking the ADI. My sister is all over it and doesn't see the issue with it. Took Bernie's is no I get it. You can't you're not going to see it. Unless you want to see it my friend and that is frustrating to be a witness of I can imagine. I thought that was interesting. I'm like man, they are like cursing and fucking figuring shit out and going twice motherfucking cocksucking cunt whenever I don't know if you guys have seen the greatest movie ever Home Alone one and two The other ones are shit. No offense. No, you know what offense fuck that they sucked the first two were beautiful, but Harry and Marv when Marvel get or Harry will get really pissed himself who got freaked you fracture your fridge a fresh. I just started saying that and so in my head when these people who work for these airlines are taking these pregnant ass pauses. They're going for Jeffrey Archer Bridget and this gentleman kind of confirmed that so thank y'all also one of the things I didn't get to say on the Adderall episode because I was rushing because I was nervous because talking about being addicted to a pill is very vulnerable to scary and you just for so many reasons because you want to keep it from yourself really. I just wanted to give a additional piece of advice that I left out last episode. I got to say every pretty much every second of every day. I have to come Myself into not taking an Adderall pill. I'm the kind of person that if I tell myself I can't do it anymore ever. Again. All I'm going to want to do is do it. I wish that's not how my brain worked. But that's how it works. So like I keep a couple pills in my desk drawer and every time I think to myself, oh, I'm second at her all I have to sit with that and go so you want to take an Adderall, huh? It's like I'm interrogating myself. Okay, so you want to take an Adderall why well, because I don't want to feel my feelings. I want to go to auto. A pilot. Oh, yeah. Is that going to really get you to where you want to be a functioning emotionally healthy adult woman? No. Well, do you think taking the Adderall is a great idea because you're going to survive without it. You're actually going to be better. All right, fine boring the boring season, but I have to have these conversations with myself all the fucking time and the na the Narcotics Anonymous meetings. I went to I guess that I went to those right I know supposed to be anonymous but I can't help myself. They're very helpful. But that was a that was something that was echoed. In almost every person that talked in those meetings is every fucking second of every day. And I know this sounds exhausting like if you are addicted to a drug currently and you're really trying to quit and you're scared that you're not going to be able to you you can you really can you just have to put a lot of work into everyday babying yourself almost to interrogate myself on my own life coach. I'm like, come on girl. You can do it. You can do it girl you can survive. Then when I survived like, you know all this time without it like going weeks without it. I'm like fuck. Yeah, you're the best person ever and then I'm like, I deserve an Adder all know. What did I just say? What'd I just say Christina? You said I shouldn't do it. Yeah, I did. Okay. So just a reminder. It's not easy. It's very hard. It's very rewarding work though. It improves your self-esteem your self-confidence, which I guess go hand in hand, but and that does wonders for your happiness. So just want to say that oh recommendation my give you a recommendation and the recommendation is very New York specific. Okay, but New York, you know all of you've heard of it, but it's pretty popular city. So the odds of you visiting it at one point in your life. It's pretty high. I saw this play last night with my friend Ashley for the seventh time. No sixth time. Excuse me. I've seen this particular play. I love theater and I love immersive theater immersive where the audience is involved in the show. But like I'm talking like Don't make me say shit, but like I want an experience. I want to feel like I'm inside a movie and there is a company called third rail Productions. I if I hit the lottery I want to fund them to I want to give them millions of dollars so they can just make eight more of these types of shows. They have an immersive theater show called then she fell and it's essentially the story of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell Alice in Wonderland, and it goes deep into Mental health and and poetry Lewis Carroll was a fucking great poet. Maybe he was a pedophile perhaps there's a lot of evidence of that and that's weird and they do address that in the play but not they do it in a perfect way. So I've seen the show six times each on a different substance talking about recovering drug addict, but not drugs that I'm addicted to I was on Adderall for most of them except the last two times. But so the first time I saw it I saw Sober second time I was a little tipsy third time. I was like, let's go to Mali. Fuck it for time. I just smoked weed fifth time. I took an edible and the sixth time I took mushrooms a chocolate and when I and this and I'm not a doctor and I'm not telling you don't do drugs kids as you guys say that legally I think but I really have been getting into mushrooms lately. I don't fully trip on them because I'm not I'm not into that. I don't want to see shit. I don't want to see triangles coming at me and I want to see my curtains being like hey Christina, like I'm good on that. But mushrooms. I don't know if I take a little bit. It's I'd say it's a little more than a microdose. It just makes me like, all right. Yeah guys, it's all going to be. Okay when I take it. I'm like, oh, I'm okay. And I feel that way days after it's a really long-lasting effect. I know mushrooms. I'm going to do an episode only on mushrooms like specifically about mushrooms on the research that I've done and then I'm going to do a segment where I take mushrooms and then I talk to you because I'm really getting into them. They have a lot of medicinal effects, but they obviously have to be Handle With Care. It's a psychedelic drug and is not for everybody. Anyway, I saw this play then she fell by third rail Productions you go to this town house in Brooklyn and my son my friend Ashley was there and in the car, right? Over there. I was kind of prepping her for the show. We had each take a little bite of chocolate and and I was like, you know, I don't know. I don't know if you're the kind of person who wants to know what to experience beforehand. But if you do let me know there's one part of the show where they kind of their loud and throwing things but other than that, it's the costumes the costume designer in the show the acting in the show its movement based a lot of this is movement-based. There's dialogue in this play, but there's it's just the movement the all so fucking powerful the costume design the sound design and the law. Lighting it's you feel like you're in a fucking movie when you see this and I am somebody who loves to get lost in my imagination. And even if your imagination is that of a brick wall. If you have no imagination, you will still enjoy this play and it will encourage you to dive into your own personal private creativity afterwards. It is such a good play. There's the audience I believe is no bigger than 13 or 14 people and you get separated you're going to get It throughout the show the second you get into the building. There's somebody in Cotton character, like people are in character. They fucking take this shit seriously and you basically get the actors will take some people to one room and some people another and you go all around this this facility. It's supposed to be a mental health facility like an old like a like a mental health clinic back in the ages of Alice Liddell and Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carroll. It is the most beautiful beautiful piece of theater that I've ever seen and it to me take something talk about the creative brain. It takes the concept of what a play can be and it fucking fucks you wrong with it. But in the best way like raw sex with someone you love that's what this play feels like. It's beautiful and I'm so I'm telling Ashley. This is just a side note, but I was telling Ashley about it. And then we were talking about how like our lives are so crazy and weird and then I mentioned about you. And then I found out my dad's on my real dad and she was like wait what and I forgot it and tell her so I told her that's whole story of the 23andMe thing. And then I'm like, yeah, my life is weird just weird shit happens to me and I kind of really loved it. And then we walk in to check into this play and then like Neil Patrick Harris comes out and I was like what Neil Patrick Harris is here. He wasn't in the play. He was just seeing it too. And I was like, that's just that's like a fun little wink from the Universe. I don't of what I don't know. He's cool. But yeah, then she fell by third rail Productions. It is beautiful. Actually. I want to read a piece of poetry that they gave me in the program because this is just an example of the type of world. They build this is poetry from Lewis Carroll one second. I got to go to my table and get it. Okay. Okay. It is a good night for ghosts. The rabbit in the moon is full and waiting to take Souls too far shores as it crosses the sky. I dreamt a dream that I was with you tonight. I woke up and my lips were numb from saying your name. I dreamt that we were dreaming a dream together you and I and we were trapped in a house big as memory countless doors you were Are I could hear you laughing? But I only caught glimpses of you in the glass eventually I gave in and found myself staring at myself reflected looking at myself looking back at me. Both of us trying to decipher the face that was in front of us my eyes seeing me in mine and countless. I have retreated into twos because of you. I wonder when you look in the mirror, who stares you down at night. But it is late and my mind is running away with itself. Sleep. Well, wherever you are. It is a good night for ghosts and between us we have a Pocketful. I mean what the fuck? I don't know if I read that appropriately. I know like poetry should be read a certain way. But I mean you forget that people can be so beautifully articulate with words and you can really finesse the English language to work and communicate. To create things and I can I forget that so seeing this play is a reminder of a lot of things for me. But one of them is the way that I use language personally and I'm trying to get better at that and not be so hyperbolic not saying it was the best thing ever. It was the most amazing. It was the worst. It was the best dick. It was the worst dick, you know, like Charles Dickens but less poignant Charles Dickens that are right. I'm doing it wrong. Okay, let's do some fuccboi Santa This edition of fuck-boy theater is bio Edition. Okay. So we're going to read the bios of these dating apps of fuccbois. And oh when we could be pieces of shit, too. Yeah fuck girls. So I read a bio from this guy as part of fuck-boy Friday last week and and then people started sending me bios, and then dude started sending me chick bios. And man, it's hard for all of us you guys. It's not easy. We all have different struggles all men and women and all the in-between. We all got stem. I kind of felt bad for the dude. Whoa for a second. I was like, oh fuck off. But so I want to read first the guy bios because they're great. But I want to save the best for last because these women oh women are scary. Let me tell you something real quick side note since current and I Doing guys you fucked and we've been going on the road. I am more scared of women than I am of men because we've had many men come to our shows alone or they drag their girlfriends or their boyfriends or their friends, but the women when they get alcohol and when young women are drunk some young women, I know not hashtag not I am a but a drunk young chick who wants something is going to stop at nothing to get it and that's very jarring. I thought we were going to get Selena like eight times. We had drunk chicks break into our dressing room multiple times in our shows like they would sneak in one girl. Oh my God, this one girl. I was at American Comedy Company actually in San Diego The Green Room. Maybe I shouldn't be saying this but don't fucking break into green rooms. If you have to hear it from me on a podcast and not do it. You got a mental problem. But the Green Room is hidden. It's behind a shelf. So you get it's very it's not obvious that the Green Room is there it's to the side of the stage. You can't really see it. So I get off stage. Karin comes on stage. Stand up the only time we're not on stage at the same time. I'm backstage and some chick comes in. Like she fucking works there. She's like hey, oh my God. I was wondering if I can get a picture and she wasn't wearing the uniforms. I was like, do you work here? And she's like, yeah. Yeah. Do you mind if I just get a quick picture real quick and I was like, oh, okay, whatever and then she goes to turn a camera and his camera to selfie mode and right before she press the button to take the photo. She slowly turns to me and she goes I don't work here. Yeah, like I'm not a die today by Christina. Nice knowing me I didn't but man that was scary. Okay, Becca boa theater bio Edition.

I got you if you have any screenshots of BIOS or long conversations between you and a fuck boy or fuck girl email them to me the voices in her head podcasts a gmail.com. Okay, let's do some random thoughts. Well a truck just crashed outside when I after I said that Binks Jesus some random thoughts that I had throughout my lifetime and specifically the past week. I was listening to this song by The Righteous Brothers and you've probably heard of it You've Lost That Loving Feeling. It's very popular song Beautiful song Oh The Righteous Brothers are wha? But the first lyric in that song is you never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips. So like this guy. Has been kissing a woman or man a person. And this person's mouth is open the entire time. So this poor guy is just kissing an open wide eyed uninterested person. Just imagine that just so just can you imagine I recall all the times? Someone is kiss me and I had my eyes wide open. You know, why because I felt mad uncomfortable. I don't want to be there. I just I just thought that was funny. another random thought Technology is getting really out of hand. If you haven't noticed some of its great, but some of it fucking sucks and it feels like everyone's opinion is just and he got notifications notifications everywhere. Your phone's like Christina. Someone want to talk to you Christina this person message you Christina, your manager wants you to call him like okay. I just feel like I'm getting pulled in all the directions. And I feel like we should bring Bieber's back. Do you remember those a lot of you probably don't because I barely remember Bieber's I never had a beeper but my fucking older brother did my only brother my brother. He's eight years older than me and he had a beeper and let me tell you kids gather round because I'll tell you beepers you call from a phone from a landline or cell phone. If you were fucking killing it with money back in the 90s and you just beep the Beeper and you could say like 9 1 one you can page at nine one one if it's emergency. I remember I beeped my brother once and I put 9-1-1 it was because I was locked out of the house and he had to leave a date. He really mad at me. I was like, I don't care I need to be inside but I just feel like the Simplicity of a beeper something I yearn to be connected with again sure, I could turn off all my notifications and just not look at my phone as much and fucking don't have it face up at every table wherever I am at any second and I'm working on it, but I just feel like beepers. All the shit from the 90s is making a comeback as vintage which is weird. Why don't we bring back beepers put them in boxes of cereal or some shit? I don't know, but I'll buy them. Another random another random thought it's kind of a topic. It's kind of a rant. Flea markets y'all know about flea markets some of you do some of you have great experiences with flea markets. I have a long. Sorted past with flea markets. I was a flea market can only talk about this, but I wanted to vent about it because I was a flea market kid. So my my father fucking amazing, man. Not my biological dad, but that's okay because a father is a person who shows up for you or whatever. I don't know. I love my dad. He's the shit. He was in the Navy and he got he actually got drafted. Is that cool? It's not really cool, but it's fun little fact, he got drafted a week before he got his college acceptance letter. And so anyway, he's stayed in the Navy and retired. He was tired when I was about six or seven years old who stayed in for a really long time and then he was just finding all these odd jobs afterwards because he didn't Do with himself and he wanted to and he there was all these businesses one of the businesses my parents decided to to have a flea market store have a little table a flea market first it started with we're going to go down to Bill's flea market in in Virginia Beach Virginia, and we're gonna fucking sell shit. But where did they get this shit at the beginning of their flea market career from trash from people's trash? So we lived in a pretty nice neighborhood. It was Virginia's the houses were expensive but like, you know, it wasn't like we had our house built and shit and you know, but then my mom would take me on what she called lovingly junking you know junking is junking is when you go through people's trash and you find the stuff that's not trash trash. And and you do it in the middle of the night at a and you realize you're outside your friend's house that's more popular than you in elementary school and you're like damn walking on thin ice mama and she's like shut up we got to do it. We got to get stuff to sell at this flea market and we would go through people's trash now. I will say we did find some gems some like legit antiques that were beautiful. Actually. I have a lamp from the trash, but we will fucking go It's a people through people's trash and then and then they got good at that good at selling that and so then they started going to auctions and fucking going to these auctions and bidding on basically hoarders who died and they want to bid on a pile of shit and I'm not it's they try to be less hyperbolic, but they would you would bid on a mountain and that is not an exaggeration. It was as tall as me of just shit bowling ball. Al's boxes of old Beanie Babies that were ripped clothes just like random shit and we would bid on these piles of shit and and then we would take it all in our my pillow. My parents got a junk in Van. They got a junk in Van. That's what they called it. It was a van that they gutted the back so they could put the junk from the trash and these auctions into the back of the van mind you I had to be with them during this whole process because I was too young to say Home Alone boy. Oh boy. I wish I was that was not the case. I did not like this shit's my parents will make me dig in the trash with them and then they will make me go to these auctions with them and then we go to flea markets and look my mom has has depression. But when she when I was in when we were in Virginia, that's when that was my form of thee. That was my I was in Virginia from age to age 10 Chesapeake Virginia and love love. I love that place, but I got bullied in school. So I hate it for that. But like, you know, I was asking for it. No, I wasn't and and so we would go like we were in this nice town and my parents are I lost my thought. I lost my train of thought but but we would fuckin go junk in and then we would go to these so they got this junk in Van. That's where I was they got this van that we would load all this junk into and we would go to the flea market. We had to buy a table. Oh, yeah bipolar. My mom's Depression was really bad when I was a kid because she was fucked up on medications and the doctors did not Not listen to her when she's like. Hey guys, these meds are making me psychotic. Can you switch them and the doctors would say shit to her like you just you're not giving enough time. Meanwhile, she's driving her car into shit and she's like, I don't usually do that. But now I'm on these pills that you gave me and I'm driving my car into stuff. Maybe I need to switch and like no no no, no little girl. We know you don't know you don't know your own body that happened a lot. I've witnessed it as a child. I wouldn't have doctors be condescending to my mom. Anyway, she was really fucked up on. Medication and and so she would sleep a lot and so we would go to my fucking friends from schools trash piles and these are hoarders auctions and and then we would take all the shit put in the van and then put all that shit in our living room. So I wouldn't I wasn't gonna have any friends sleep over. Because my living room was covered in trash and we would you know, sort out the few good shit, you know, the good things in these piles and then throw everything else away and then we would go load that up in the van after she priced it. She had a price sheet of pricing gun and she priced at all. I was where I was sucked the most helpful fucking kid. I was basically a butler and we would go to these flea markets and then she'll be in the van. She would fucking fall asleep because she was medicated heavily medicated and she was so Heard all the time and I'm six fucking years old at this bumblefuck flea market this hillbilly fuck flea market and I say hillbilly because I fucking mean it. Okay, and these people would be looking at this table of the least shittiest junk that we got from the trash, you know, I didn't tell them that but they like a guy would come up to me and we're like, we were 12 miles from the North Carolina border. So it was I mean people had thick Southern Accents and they'd be like, hey little lady. How much is that Chandelier and what period is it from and I be like, um, hold on one second, please and then I would go in the van and they don't have to wake my mom up and that took an hour because she was so heavily medicated that it took her forever to wake the fuck up. So be like Mom, excuse me. There's a man he's asking what the period of the chandelier. I don't know what he's saying and my mom would be like swap me away. Like I was a fly. Because she didn't know where she was. I'm like ma scuse me, Mom, but mommy you need to there's a man. He wants to buy if he has money in his hand and he wants to buy it and the guys like, excuse me, how much and what payer it is is from like, I'm sorry. I'm trying so hard and I'll try to wake her up and she's like, oh, I don't know 40 bucks. I'm like, oh and then I will go out and like, okay. Okay, so it's $40. She didn't ask about the period thing, but you know, it's $40. We take 35 p.m. And had to go back in the van. I go back in the van of like Mom and then she fucking fell back into a deep-ass sleep and I have to wake her up at spend 20 more minutes wake her up. Like would you take 35 mom? Would you take third? Yes, I'm like, yeah, and then I got out there like sir. She will take 35 and he's gone. He left. It was really a thankless job. I fucking hate flea markets. So I this was my I would say from age. I don't know sevenish to 10 3 3 important years. I was just flea markets and Junkin and me try not to cry and wearing black as I dig through my friend's moms pile of trash at night. And then eventually they got like their skills with flea market and finding things to sell got better. So they went from digging and trash which they found great shit. But like I'm a kid, let me play with the Barbies and then from, you know bidding on these auction piles and then they actually bought shit wholesale eventually and had a store it was a collectible toy store. It was called toy connection and it was in Virginia Beach and I had to be at that store all the fucking time and I hated it. My point is We markets can suck my dick they can suck my dick. I am so so I an ex-boyfriend of mine. I dated if you listen to guys we fucked, you know, my ex-boyfriend Steven what like a couple years into US dating maybe four or five we were on we were traveling we were doing a road trip and there was a flea market and had pinball we're obsessed with pinball and so he's a call it stopped at this pinball. I found a pinball place and we pull up and it's a fucking flea market and looks exactly like fucking bills flea market and fucking Virginia Beach and I Start sweating and he's like dude you okay. I'm like, I fucking hate flea markets and I well I will take $35 but the guy left and how was I supposed to know because Mom was sleeping. I just I really some people have like weird quirks. One of my weird quirks is fucking flea markets. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do flea markets. This is a random thought. And then on ditional rollerblading tip that I just wanted to throw out there for all the babes on blades club members again, if you want to be a member of babes on blades you are you're already a babe. So check one and then just get blades wear a hat or earmuffs when it's chilly out guys because let me tell you colds coming through your ears a doctor told me a couple times and I went rollerblading without earmuffs or a hat the other day and it was called out and my ears were Numb by the time I got back and then I got a cold. So I just wanted to let you know to like bundle up. And also if you own roller skates that counts as babes on blades your blade your wheels are just arranged differently, but that you're just as much of a babe. Okay? I hope you enjoyed this episode. I had fun. I'm in my bra. I don't know. I told you that but I just wanted to say it because I just looked down and I was like, okay titties. I like having boobs having boobs is great. I've heard guys say sometimes like man if I have boobs out play with them all day. Honestly, I do I have them and I fucking do their fun. And if I have balls you fucking bet they'd be in my hands all goddamn day except for arm around children are in public because that's illegal. I'm the one thing. I miss I miss a lot of things about being in a relationship like the companionship having someone who gets you not being alone. But one of the things I really like a little thing that I really enjoy about being in a relationship and being very comfortable with someone is playing with their balls. Every time I had a boyfriend I would just hope I get the biggest kick when guys do the mangina River. Do you guys do that? You ever had a guy do that? I don't mean to be insensitive your Trans in this offends you but A couple boyfriends. I've had a couple guys that I fucked it those two. I don't like oh, this is funny. You're cool. They'll take their balls. They're digging their balls and they're just they'll tuck it like a drag queen a drag queen has to tuck their dick and balls in but you know so that when they come out in a one-piece, you don't see their dick and balls and let me tell you they do a great fucking job and those puppies go right into that butt crack and up up and away, but my my 1X do this thing called it's called mangina and he would just tuck it and then walk around and I was like that. That's all fine knee and then he would do helicopter dick. We would take his flaccid dick and just make it spin around and I just got the biggest kick out of that. Anyway next week.

Alright King sirs. Welcome back to another amazing episode of the kinkiest fuck podcast as we said before we're going to be handing this over to V. Who's going to be talking to all of S types the slaves the subs the bottoms the pets the littles and anyone who is on the right side of the / we're going to be handing you over to Vie for a little bit of a message to the subs take it away V. Thank you so much sir. I appreciate that. So just to recap last week the Reverend talked about, you know, the importance of the dominant or those left of the / I'm sure that they take the time for self-care for making sure that their needs are met that way. They can continue to contribute to their Dynamic and a healthy way. So we thought it was important to talk to those who are right of the slash because it is a team effort to make sure that everybody involved in this Dynamic is happy healthy and productive and living a fulfilled Dynamic a fulfilled life as well as making sure that the dynamic is stable it takes two to tango. As they say so or in some cases three or four depending on what your Dynamics are, but it's very important that all parties involved focus on the self care aspect of things and helped themselves to navigate burnout because we all feel that there's no way to avoid it life gets crazy. You're going to experience it. But how can you get through it in a healthy and productive way? So that's really what I want to be able to focus on today with those of us who are on the right side of the / now this doesn't I mean that those of you who are left to the / can just go ahead and you know, stop listening right now because there are some things that you know still be pertinent for you guys things that can definitely translate across the / divide. It will also be some good things for you to remember to remind your your s types or those that are right of the slash to help remind them. Hey, I need you to be able to do this for us. We're in agreement that we are both going to take care of each other by making sure we take care of ourselves as So, please don't stop listening just because you think this doesn't pertain to you because I assure you there will be little nuggets in here that you can you know that you can run with so first and foremost. I really want to touch on something that's your touched on last week about that whole misconception that comes from needing to take a step back or needing to say hey, I need help or sir respectfully. Can I put things on a pause real? Real quick because life is too crazy. We especially as those who were right of the slash. I don't know where it came from. I don't know who started this nonsense, but whoever they are. I just want to smack him upside the head and tell them no, but there is this very negative stigma out there that if you as the S-Type the slave the submissive the property whatever that if you have to say sir, I can't do that. You right now because I'm having a hard time that suddenly well, you're not really a true submissive because you didn't automatically say, yes, sir, or yes, ma'am. And now you fail in your role as a whatever and I think that's absolute Bull crunky and it's ridiculous and it needs to stop everyone has things going on in their life. You don't only exist in this Dynamic you are not only your Sir, or your Mam's slave submissive pet property whatever you also have a family you have friends. You have a job you have other responsibilities. You have life. I know you've heard us say this time and time before on the podcast life before lifestyle. Guess what your life is going to impact your Dynamic no matter what you do and it's unfair to yourself and it's unfair to your partner to expect that it I won't so it's okay to take that time and realize I am burnt out you could be stuck in a job that you absolutely hate and things are really tough. Especially around the holiday season. I don't care what field of work you are in the holiday seasons are rough for everybody at work. That's where you experience the most burnout that's where your experience the most stressors. And so you're going to bring that home with you. No one is perfect. No one knows how to effectively leave it at the office your Bad mood you're grumpy attitude. You got yelled at by the boss. It's gonna come back with you and that's okay. So how can you protect yourself and protect your Dynamic you communicate you talk to your partner and you tell them hey, it was a rough day today. I'm going to need some extra minutes of cuddle time with you or I'm going to need some extra minutes where I am in whichever position that you guys have agreed upon that is you are this is my slave position the My ready position if you use positions or if there's a mantra that you use you can approach your your dominant type and say I really need to do this. I know I already did it today, but can we take you know five minutes where it's just me and you and I can try to get back into this happier headspace for myself and I guarantee you most ominous will be like, oh, of course come here. Let's make this happen for you. Yes, because you know those of us that are left of this lashes. Well want to take care of those that are right of the / go figure so communicate if you have a need communicate it it doesn't mean you're weak. It doesn't mean you're flawed. It doesn't mean you suck at being the S-Type. I'm sorry. None of us are Super Subs. None of us can do everything without ever bitching and complaining without ever feeling like it's too much. There's always going to be something going on and that's okay. Give yourself a break. Be nice to yourself and tell yourself that it's okay to be human and it's okay to have needs now. I'm not saying that it's okay to come home and start yelling at your dominant or your master or your mistress and just say it's been a bad day. I just deal with it. We want to make sure that we're being respectful even when we're having a hard time, right? And I know that's not easy. You just got yelled at and you know normal human behavior is I pass along that negativity we send out those All's it sucks. So we as those right of the / we do have a responsibility to ourselves to our partners to the rest of the world to make that conscious effort to not send those negative ripples out into the world. It starts and ends with us, right and it's a lot easier said than done but trust me. I know it's something that I'm continually working on. I know it's something that my sir is continually working on. He's a lot better at it than I am though because he's very much that just go with the flow and everything. Sings O BK B baby, but it's very important that even though we're having a rough time that were not being disrespectful. This isn't carte blanche saying yes, of course yell kick scream throw things because you're mad. We're adults. We are not allowed to have temper tantrums, but we are allowed to communicate our wants and needs you're allowed to go to your person who's left of the / and say I am in need of a hug right now. Now I am just in need of a listening ear or if you have it already established within your Dynamic that you can approach them and say Hey, can I have five minutes outside of dynamic to talk to you about this thing? That's really Weighing on me and fingers crossed. If you've got a good person who's left of the slash. They will 100% be an agreement to meet you in that place and to talk things through with you and to help you get to a better place. I guess. This is a good point to kind of make my little coffee. Here if they're not willing to do that for you. That's a time to really evaluate whether this is a healthy dynamic because any individual who is not willing to meet you where you are at and talk with you and get you to a better place. It's not a healthy Dynamic if you care about someone if you love someone you want them to live their best life. You want them to meet their full potential and if you are unwilling to help them with that then Sorry, it's time to move on and find somebody else. I've seen way too many good people strive and work for for making themselves better and for becoming stronger in their roles just across the board in work in life in families in Dynamics. And the other party is not willing to work with them and it's just not going to work if that's the case because you're always going to be butting against a brick wall. You're always going to be running into dead ends and it's going to be Rail your progress. Don't do that to yourself value yourself enough to walk away from unhealthy people and unhealthy relationships. That's just my little soapbox. I'm going to step on down now, but talk to them. Let your partner know what's going on with you. I mean case in point for me recently. I had, you know a horrible experience with my former job to the point where I needed to quit It was just I had reached my breaking point and it needed to happen. I was in a very grumpy bad mood so much that it caused my physical symptoms to flare up really bad and I could have easily started being Miss grumpy pants and ger and snapping at my sir because let's face it, you know six plus years ago. That's exactly what I would have done. I would have been in a sour mood and damn it. You're just going to have to deal with the fact that I'm in a sour mood because well, I'm in a sour mood. But luckily, you know growing and learning I was able to communicate with my sir. Hey, this is where I'm at. This is my head space. Yes. I'm depressed. Yes. I'm having a hard time dealing with you know rage and a sense of loss and grieving because this is a company I've been with for five years like I put in my two weeks notice on my five year anniversary with this company. So there was a lot that I felt I was losing so I was grieving There was a lot of anger there because how dare they treat me this way a lot of indignation and a lot of fear about will crap. What are we gonna do about money, but I was able to talk to my sister about all of that. I was able to fill him in on where my head was at and when I got so wrapped up in my own head and went internal and stopped communicating Meister stepped up and checked in with me. He came to me and said where are you at? How are you doing? I noticed that your body language is really tense what's going on in that head of yours and he was able to bring me out of myself to where I could communicate and talk things out and ultimately get to a better place. So those of you left of the / this is kind of your homework assignment for the rest of your Dynamic pay attention to your S-Type pay attention to your partner whose right of the Slash and yes, it is their responsibility. Ability to know themselves and to bring their needs to you but there are going to be some times where they are. So overwhelmed that they can't so watch out for that and poke and prod gently and just be like hey, how are you? Where are you at? Is there anything that you need to talk to me about anything? I can help with and usually that lets them know it's safe and it's okay to let everything you know go and to lay it at your feet and just say this is what I'm experiencing. And now as types that does not mean that you are now going to like word vomit all your problems onto your poor dominant and they're just like I don't know what to do with this now help me help you but it does mean let them know where you're at. It's not a bad thing to be depressed. It is not a bad thing to feel overwhelmed. It's not a bad thing to be burnt out just communicate it. Your dominant is wonderful. They are supportive in taking on that role left of the slash. They are making themselves responsible for your well-being for protecting you for protecting you from yourself as well as from others, but it's not fair to expect them to fix you. That's a job for you to do every person is responsible for themselves first and foremost. So if you are having a hard time if You are experiencing depression or being overloaded or overwhelmed or burnt out you need to know what your self care needs are now. I know a lot of us as types really haven't delved that deep on our own end because we're always so concerned with taking care of everybody else. You become that after thought. I know I'm guilty of that. My friends have described me as the mother. Hen type where I will go around and I will make sure everybody else is taking care of your sick. Let me Make sure you get to your doctor's appointments. You're having a rough time. Let me go spend time with you and cheer you up and I'm focused on everybody else so much that I neglect myself or when I'm sick. I'm like, yeah, whatever. It's no big deal. I don't need to go to the doc dates fine. Oh, I'm not important. Let me focus on you guys instead and to be fair a lot of that stems from a low self-esteem and feeling like you personally are not worth much and I know this isn't true for all all of those right of the slash, but I know a lot of us experience those feelings on some level at which point, you know pot meeting Kettle pot would still like to tell you that that's nonsense and you are amazing and you are valuable and you are a value simply because you are you yeah, that's something I have to keep telling myself to so just make that your mantra for a while if you're feeling like you weren't worth any of this effort, but you need to be able The sit down and write out a list of what are the what are the things that recharge you what are the things that bring you Joy? Not what brings your master or your Madam or your mistress Joy because I mean granted seeing them happy makes us happy. That's just our nature. But what are genuinely the things that make you happy? What are the things that that make your soul feel alive for some of us? Yes, that is service, and that's great. But you can't always be in service if you're burnt out. So what are some of the other things you can do? I know for me it's being artistic and crafty and creating things. So whether it's painting or you know recently making all of these amazing custom Tumblers or or designing new decals and stuff to make or you know, getting ready for the wedding putting together all of the florals that I told others that they would help me make and then all of a sudden it's like that's what they're all done. I got frustrated. So I needed Thing to do. Haha so find those things that make sense to you. Is that taking a bubble bath? Is that reading a book? Is it going on a hike everybody has that one thing that just kind of makes them feel centered again and it helps just wash away all of that unnecessary stress. I know for me it helps to just zone out or sorry not sewn up, but tune out the rest of the world and really hone in on. On creating this new thing this expression of my creativity being able to morph things and create is just really what what brings me back down to an even Keel and for a long time. I stopped doing that for myself. There were those what about two and a half three years where I completely stopped doing anything creative or artistic and I crashed and burned hard at the beginning of this year and it took A real big toll on me mentally as well as physically which really stinks but you got to make sure you're taking care of yourself so find those things get back to them or if you don't know what they are start exploring sign up for you know, one of those paint and wind nights and see if that's something that Sparks your interest pick up a good book. If you don't know any good books go to your local library and talk to a librarian and see what they're passionate about and you know, check it out read it. If you're not a big reader, but you still like stories audible is amazing. Audio books are fantastic and it's a way for you to just kind of Escape without having to focus on anything else but a good story for others. It's sitting down and just playing video games for for that afternoon or that evening to just be like, you know what I know. I'm an adult and I have all these other things that are going on, but forget that I need to just relax and be a teenager or a middle as my sir would And sometimes that's the best self care so find out what your self care is and I know that's hard and a lot of us are so wrapped up in our dominant type or our partner that's left of the Slash and everything becomes about them and we lose sight of ourselves. So this is an opportunity to find yourself again because most Partners left of the slide. - don't want mindless soulless automatons as their partner right of the / they want a unique individual. They want that unique energy and experience with you. So don't let yourself be lost in them. Yeah, I could wow. I'm getting up on my soapbox a lot with this one. I'm sorry. You guys different soap boxes at least, right? All right. So I've mentioned several times that it's important to remember that when we are communicating our wants and needs that we do so respectfully and I'm sure you guys are listening going. Yeah, that's great. But how you keep saying to do it, but you don't tell me how to do it. So I kind of want to give an example or a sort of template now. I understand that this might not work for everybody modify it tweak it make it your own make it what works for you and your Dynamic talk it over with your dominant type with your partner left of the / make sure that they agree that this is a productive and positive way to communicate with them because again, we don't want to be making unilateral decisions for our dynamic because that's not our place in our chosen role as those right of the slash. But I believe it's very important to start off with an approach you use your honorifics. I mean normally Are honorifics involved even when you communicate I know my sir is my husband and all that good stuff, but I still approach him as sir. I don't think I've used his legal first name. All that often, like honestly, it only happens like when were around his family because even around my family because my family knows all of this. He is Sir to the point where my mom even calls him sir. It's hilarious. So approach with the honorifics and simply state that I'm having a hard time right now. I would like the opportunity to talk with you about XY and Z for others. It's sir ma'am madam. Owner I'm having a hard time and I would like to request an opportunity to speak outside of dynamic to address this. These are all things as well. Please keep in mind if this isn't already in your contract or if you don't already have a contract between you and your partner because I know some of us are you know, under consideration and all that jazz, but this is something that you can put into either an existing contract or make sure you put into an upcoming contract you want to be able to have an opportunity to speak freely to speak openly outside of dynamic or you're not so worried about the honorifics and playing and I'm using air quotes here playing the demure and quiet submissive type that it seems to be really the the expected image of those of us right of the Slash. And for those of you that know me, I definitely don't fit that description at all. I am always opinionated and Out and this is what I would like to do sir. And I really really would like to do it. I've gotten better about saying that versus this is what I'm going to do kthxbai. But okay, so make sure that you have this in your documentation somewhere or it will be in your documentation that you have the ability to speak freely without the threat of consequence. Like if you're having a really hard time if your dominant is expecting, you know. Reasonable things from you and you know, sometimes it does happen that way it might not be intentional. They might think you are fully capable of doing it and you're sitting there going there are only 24 hours in a day and I would like some amount of sleep. So no, I will not detail your car after every single day that you are out because I just worked a 12-hour shift. I had to make dinner I had to do laundry. I had to clean the house. I don't have time to detail your car to you know, those kinds of things you need. Have the outlet to be able to say hey, this isn't working for me. I feel like I'm a failure because I cannot get your entire list of tasks completed. I feel like I'm letting you down which in turn makes me feel, you know, like a horrible and I don't deserve you and that I'm failing this Dynamic and then you spiral and it's really bad. So you need to be able to speak freely and to feel safe speaking freely and it's okay so that that sounded A little harsh, but I know a lot of us to in Dynamic. We are worried about disappointing or upsetting our top are dominant our master or mistress. And so that in and of itself whether they have put that fear into us or not is totally irrelevant. We have internalized it we have made that a legitimate fear. So knowing that your dominant is okay to talk outside of dynamic kind of helps take that away so that you speak Freely, and really let them know what's going on because if you're holding back, if you're not telling them everything that's bugging you if you're not telling them everything that is preventing you from doing what you want to do for them. Then they can't really help they can't really solve the problem. If they don't know all of the facts you're doing yourself a disservice and you're doing them a disservice. So make sure you can speak freely without fear of repercussions of Punishments, you know heaven forbid you say Hey sir. This task is way too much and they go. Oh, oh, that's too much. Well, boom. Here's five more big tasks for you to do. If you don't get it done. You're sleeping on the floor or you're getting swats or something. Yeah. Now again, if your dominance doing that you might want to revisit this because that's not healthy and that's not safe for you mentally especially so sorry put the Soap Box away. Okay, so back on track speak safely and freely, whether that's still in dynamic or outside of dynamic depending on the severity of the issue at hand, but even outside of dynamic that doesn't mean you now have permission to start yelling and cussing at your dominant type. You still want to be respectful because that's just how you would treat people in general rule of thumb if you yell and throw a hissy fit people tune you out. We don't like hearing it. So we don't listen to it. You may have absolutely valid things to say, but because you are yelling and screaming and using profanity. I'm less likely to actually hear your message and just write it off as well. That's his temper tantrum. Good job for you. Now, I've got to teach you a lesson because you can't act like an adult. So we want to make sure that we are getting our message across in a productive way. So tone it down. You don't need to yell. They've agreed to sit down and talk with you just talk. Now I'm not saying you have to be monotone and emotionless. You're allowed to cry you're allowed to show your frustration. You may get a little bit louder because you're really passionately feeling whatever emotions are going on. Let them know that let them know. I'm not I'm not mad at you or if you are you can say look. I'm having a really hard time with something you did, but I still love you. I just need to get this out. That way they're kind of prepared and they're not going to Medically respond by you know yelling back at you or cutting you off before you actually get your phone message out because now they're on the defensive. So talk don't yell. Don't scream. Don't cuss talk. If you're overwhelmed at work, and it's preventing you from really getting into things within your Dynamic share that share that you're overwhelmed your overburdened. You're feeling like there's too much on your plate and ask. Is there anything that you can take off of my plate for this time being and provide a time frame don't just say indefinitely. Just don't just say take it off my plate period but say hey, I think I might need You know two weeks a month two months where one or two things or five or ten things depending on what what your plate looks like are removed so I can get through this time and you know, your partner left of the / has every right to then say, okay. So what I'm hearing is and this is the important part. This is how dialogue works the first Speaker talks the the other party listens to apprehend. I want you to hear that again you listen to comprehend all of us. I know I've been guilty of it way too many times. We listen to respond which means we're not hearing the full message. We're not giving the other party a chance to actually tell us what's going on. We're hearing your bad person you're doing this to me you've done this and so we're like no. No, that's not what I did. Let me let me respond to this. Let me rebuttal this let Prove that I'm not a bad person don't do that. Don't do that because that just cripples the communication. So you listen to comprehend. Once the first person is done talking The Listener will then paraphrase or summarize what they heard so you will say, okay. What I'm hearing is you're overwhelmed at work a lot is going on and you're feeling like you're not Not able to give me a hundred percent here in the dynamic. So you're requesting if there are some things that can be taken off of your plate. Is that right? And then the original speaker our in this scenario our S-Type will then go yes, that is correct. Then our person left of the / has the opportunity to give their input. That's when they have the right to say. Okay. I hear what you're saying. Now. There are some tasks that I have given. You that I feel are still very important and I don't feel comfortable removing them from your plate whether that's the honorifics whether that's the good morning text, whether that's the daily Mantra or whether that's you know, if you've given them self-care tasks like, you know, you get up and you take a shower every day, especially for those of us who suffer from depression where you just don't want to do anything for yourself and you can go weeks without showering, you know, those kinds of things. So you want to make sure that you communicate that so that this message is to those left of the / or anybody in a conversation where you were the original listener, share your side of things to this is a two-way discussion. This is not a dictatorship. This is not a hostage situation where you are now given a list of Demands you're able to talk and discuss these things so meet them halfway at least if you can. Tell them hey, I hear where you're at. I understand that you're overwhelmed and you're overstressed. Yes. I can help with this by easing the burden on this side by removing this this or that for x amount of time you can now counter if they say I need two months. You can say tell you what I'll give you three weeks and then we'll revisit and see where you're at. But always make sure you guys have a timeline in place because if you leave it open things are just going to keep going going and going and going and it'll just be forgotten and it'll never be put back on the plate or you never come back and talk about it openly and it leads to resentment. I've seen it happen. It's not pretty give yourself a timeline to check in add it to your phone at it to your calendars. We all have these amazing smartphones now just put it in there make a note to yourself. Tell Siri or tell Google. Hey set a reminder that in three weeks. I need to check in with so-and-so about this topic and it'll do that and look at that. You don't Remember on your own but communicate discuss. This is not a dictatorship on either side. It should always be open. You should always welcome the input from the other partner now granted those left of the / have final say but both parties have a right to discuss and to express their wants and needs for any given situation. So our individual left of the slash has just you know, given their response to what the right side of the slash is needs are this is also an opportunity to say. Hey, I witnessed that you're having a hard time with this and I know that you've let this self-care tasks taper off and just fall away to nothing. I've noticed that you stopped painting or I've noticed that you stopped reading your books or I noticed that you haven't taken a bubble bath with your with your scent. Candles in a long time so I'm going to give you a task. I know you just asked me not you know, I know you just ask me to take things away, but I'm going to give you the task right now to go do that self-care thing. Go paint. Go read your book go take that bubble bath. I've got things handled out here. That is the one thing you can do for me and yourself right now, and then usually that's the end of the conversation. You guys have a plan of action moving forward. You have a date too. To check in and make sure that things are still working the way you wanted them to work and you're good to go. Both parties feel like they were heard and like genuinely heard not just that you got to say your piece but that it was heard in its entirety and that really is the most important component of communication and building a healthy relationship a healthy Dynamic. I mean, this is important for all relationships not just You know dominant-submissive Dynamics so communicate talk to each other respectfully do your best not to raise voices do your best not to get defensive do your best not to be offensive, you know, don't come at your dominant thing. You did this to me. Don't come out you're submissive going. Well, if you would just be better that doesn't help anything. This is not a fault finding Expedition. It shouldn't be anyways. This is simply about stating where you are currently at and what your wants are needs are to get to a better place. So where do we go from here? All right. So now you've done the really well one of the hard Parts I should say you've made your needs known you've let your partner know where you're at. So now what do you do you were you just been given this this temporary reprieve if you will you've been given a lighter task load. You've been allowed this time to really decompress and take care of you. So now what There are two options and one is definitely better than the other one is you can sit and wallow in all of your stress and all of your angst and all of your your nasty. No feel good that make you feel like you're having a terrible horrible. No good very bad day week life whatever or you can now take this opportunity. You can take this lighter load to take on the really important task of fixing your shit. So if you are overwhelmed at work take this time to really focus on either your time management or just knuckling down and getting that task done or coming home after the boss has been just the worst person in the world and just saying Hey, sir, ma'am. I love you so much, but it's been a bad day. I'm going to need to go paint for a while, or I'm going to need to sit down and read my book for a while, but definitely work. Those those coping skills for dealing with whatever is going on. If it's a bad round of depression everyone who has depression knows this they've been told this by their psychologist by their psychiatrist by their friends and family. You cannot let it consume new. You cannot just lay there and do nothing and stay in the dark because all that does is perpetuate the depression. You've got to work on it. You've got to make sure R taking your meds you've got to make sure that you are still engaging with people that doesn't mean you have to do it all the time. It doesn't mean every free moment. You have got to inundate yourself with social interaction and activities because that's not realistic that's not possible. But you've got to get yourself moving remember physics an object in motion stays in motion an object at rest stays at rest if we allow ourselves to just dive into that depression and sit there and wallow in it. We're not going to get better and when our person left of the / checks back in with us in a week two weeks a month. We're not going to be in any better of a position because we didn't work on fixing it. We have that responsibility. And so does the person left with the slash if they're the ones that say Hey, I'm having a hard time with this right now. I need to you know, not put the brakes on things but slow things down a little bit and you know, he's up because I've Focus on this either partner the moment you've been given that green light to take things easier in the dynamic to focus on you take that time and actually focus on addressing those issues because it's not fair to your partner to give all of these concessions without you taking advantage of it full advantage of it and taking that opportunity to address the concerns. And to correct the problems and if you don't know how to do that, that's okay. That's when it's important to ask if you need help, you know getting out of that depression. Tell your dominant. Hey right now, I'm just going to need you to check on me every day. Make sure I've showered make sure I'm eating healthy. I'm not just grabbing, you know, chocolate bars and Nutella covered bread and toast and all that jazz like make sure I'm eating healthy. Make sure I'm taking care of my laundry. Make sure I you know get out of the house at least three times a week, you know, and that's something that's a that's a reasonable request people that love you are going to check in on you. They're going to want to make sure that you're doing healthy things for yourself. Even if you need that Kickstart, that's okay. Ask for that Kickstart, but you've got to keep it going you've got to know yourself and you've got to know the problems well enough to address those concerns. Now I know a lot of this talk has been very, you know heavy it's been kind of on the Bleak side. But I also want to say it's really important to also communicate when things are going really good. You shouldn't only complain when things are bad. If you're having a really good day or there's something you're person left of the / did that just made your day. Tell them tell them you're really happy give them extra cuddles and kisses and Noms and be like you're amazing because you did X Y and Z and those of you left of the / do the same thing for your partner's right of the / communicate when times are good communicate when times are bad communicate everything with each other. It doesn't hurt a dynamic it. Strengthens it if there is open dialogue between all parties involved. Like there's very few that can go wrong a lot of problems in relationships and in Dynamics come from a lack of communication very rarely. Is it from an overabundance of communication? So share those happy moments to share those positive exchanges share the things that just brought you Joy if something really good happen. It work share that with your partner. If something really cool is going on with your family share that with your partner. If your partner just did the most adorable, you know derp inducing thing. Tell them that they are the most Fantastical person in the world. So I don't want this to all be you know, Doom and Gloom and oh when problems arise you can take you can do self-care and you can make you know communication all the more effective in the good. Times two. So just talk to each other love each other make sure everybody is taking care of and taking care of themselves. I know my Mantra and I think sirs Mantra this year as well has really been you cannot pour from an empty cup. So each of us is responsible for making sure that our cup stays full while we take care of our other people that we care about So love yourselves first and foremost love each other respect each other respect yourself respect your boundaries respect your needs.
